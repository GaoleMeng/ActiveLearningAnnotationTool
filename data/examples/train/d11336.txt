in articl 1993apr22 222016 25628 lehman com pmetzger snark shearson com perri e metzger write you obvious haven t read the inform about the system the chip put out serial number infom into the cypher stream to allow themselv to be identifi the system doe not reli on regist peopl as own particular phone unit i am against the propos but let be accur in our object do not presum to tell me what i have and have not read the system mai not reli upon regist peopl as own particular phone unit but it is necessari to know which phone unit ar like to be us for some suspect crimin commun befor you can obtain their unit kei from escrow thi necess rais the stake in favor of a crimin s coerc or collud us of some other person s clipper phone i will restat my assumpt more explicitli and amplifi my argument the origin titl perhap should have been distinct between legal and illeg cipher system consid harm but clipper consid harm is not inaccur and is more ey catch in the current context assumpt 1 clipper is made avail 2 law ar pass to make us of cipher system other than clipper illeg either on radio system or on ani common carrier system these law also includ enforc author to listen across the relev radio spectrum or other medium character signal valid clipper wrapper detect probabl us of non clipper cipher and make such detect a caus for further action 3 for escrow kei to be us some specif clipper chip must be associ with a suspect crimin thi mean that at a minimum some associ between the common carrier s uniqu phone id esn and the clipper chip serial number n will be store in a govern databas an observ pair of n and esn other than the on record rais a red flag 4 to reduc ordinari fraud the cellphon system which offer clipper will also be construct with an esn mechan much more tamper proof and much less spoofabl than todai s cellphon 5 crimin want inscrut commun some crimin ar not entir stupid or ignor and will figur out both that clipper cellphon offer excel secur in normal circumst and that thei offer no secur against law enforc onc a presum legitim wiretap order exist thei will also figur out that the wiretap order must necessarili be against a specif cellphon becaus each on ha a uniqu unit kei 6 crimin do not want to call attent to themselv becaus thei ar not stupid or ignor or becaus thei read netnew and becaus thei know that their open us of a non clipper cipher is like to be detect thei will gener avoid us non clipper cipher directli on some monitor tappabl channel thei know that do so would rais a red flag put a given cellphon if not a given person under immedi suspicion 7 it is impract to revers engin skipjack discov famili kei f and construct a function clone of a clipper chip by 2 3 4 and 7 it will be veri difficult to spoof a given clipper phone without immedi detect becaus it is difficult to obscur on s associ to a specif phone by reprogram or chang chip around the crimin will be motiv to find an intact phone which is associ with someon els a non stupid crimin will conclud that thei can have clipper secur commun at least for some limit time t if thei bui beg borrow or steal us of someon s phone in a wai that prevent that person from report compromis of the phone for at least time t the encrypt commun might have been record and thu be retriev later but the crimin can delai and quit like evad discoveri by destroi or abandon the phone befor t elaps it would be unusu for an innoc person to volunt us of their clipper phone to someon els the honest subscrib doesn t want to pai someon els s bill and he doesn t want to fall under suspicion thi leav two sourc of clipper phone for crimin us coercion and collus coercion first theft bear a rel low risk but also sometim a low time until detect a few minut if a phone is stolen from a car park in front of a store a coupl of week if a phone is stolen from someon who is awai on vacat crimin commerc is like to aris in stolen clipper phone with phone come from risk inur poor crimin and cash come from risk avers wealthi crimin someon who is extraordinarili motiv to gain a dai or two of undetect commun like a terrorist could kill a person or hold them hostag the limit time befor detect that a coerc phone is us mean that continu crimin enterpris requir a continu suppli of freshli coerc phone there would also be creat a collus commerc between rel wealthi crimin and ignor or don t care patsi who need monei and who will submit to be paid in return for subscrib to clipper phone servic for someon els s us crimin will learn that it is more to their advantag to coerc us of a clipper cellphon than it is to appli a non clipper cipher to a normal cellphon thei will call much less attent to themselv or at least to their stolen phone thi wai the fact of a phone s us be coerc must first be report befor it can be identifi as an interest phone and have it kei obtain from escrow clipper also allow an extraordinari opportun for the crimin to conceal us of super encrypt an autom full system surveil mechan quit feasibl across radio bandwidth which know famili kei f can valid clipper wrapper and n esn associ but it cannot reveal in realtim the us of super encrypt unless it know all unit kei which we ar be assur ar onli to be made avail in two separ piec upon specif wiretap like order wherea a crimin s us of ani cipher within a normal cleartext medium would stand out a crimin s us of a non clipper cipher within a clipper medium would be veri difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk record as long as the associ between crimin and specif clipper chip is fractur if you make us of thi other cipher illeg per se then you can charg the crimin with thi if you can identifi the true crimin he ll be us someon els s phone but you ll have no evid to help you against whatev tradit crime he might have been plan you will not even be abl to detect that unusu encrypt commun ar occur until you identifi specif phone and obtain their kei from escrow the gangster and terrorist ar thu arguabl more not less secur than thei were befor clipper came along i therefor consid clipper harm becaus 1 it doe not provid absolut privaci to the honest public against aggress or dishonest govern 2 if other cipher ar proscrib it engend new type of direct crimin threat to the honest public 3 it provid an extraordinarili effect mechan for crimin to hide their us of some other cipher make it more difficult than ever even to gain notic that unusu commun ar occur and that plan for some crimin act might be in progress 4 if other cipher ar proscrib lazi investig and prosecutor ar more like to pursu the easili quantifi cipher us crime than thei ar the tradit and directli harm crime which kei escrow is claim to help against 5 if other cipher ar proscrib the stage is set for witch hunt of illeg cipher us becaus ani comput can be us as a cipher machin brad yearwood brad optilink com uunet pyramid optilink brad petaluma ca
