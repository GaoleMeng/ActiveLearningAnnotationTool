i m work on an x11r5 applic and have concern regard standard colormap the x11r5 document sai usual a window manag creat these colormap i wonder what window manag the writer had in mind neither twm or mwm seem to creat standard colormap of cours on can us xstdcmap to creat standard colormap howev xstdcmap doesn t seem to try veri hard to avoid conflict with the default colormap when i us standard colormap creat by xstdcmap the rest of my displai goe black so it seem as if us of standard colormap caus the veri problem standard colormap ar intend to avoid perhap if everi applic us standard colormap thing would be wonder but not mani applic seem to us standard colormap final the oper of the function xmugetcolormapalloc xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsist with the section 14 3 of the x11r5 xlib document accord to the section 14 3 of the x11r5 xlib document p 436 for grayscal colormap onli the colormap red_max red_mult and base_pixel member ar defin the other member ar ignor to comput a grayscal pixel valu us the follow express grai red_mult base_pixel 0xffffffff xmugetcolormapalloc defin in mit lib xmu cmapalloc c is us by xmulookupstandardcolormap defin in mit lib xmu lookupcmap c to select red_max green_max and blue_max valu for the call to xmustandardcolormap when the rgb_grai_map properti is specifi xmugetcolormapalloc set red_max to 30% of the total number of cell in the grai scale set green_max to 59% of the total number and set blue_max ot 11% of the total number refer to section 14 3 on would expect xmugetcolormapalloc to set red_max to the total number of cell in the grai scale when the rgb_grai_map properti is specifi xmustandardcolormap defin in mit lib xmu stdcmap c set red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal to 1 refer to section 14 3 on would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignor when red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal 1 xmucreatecolormap defin in mit lib xmu crcmap c construct a grai map the sum of red_max green_max and blue_max give the maximum grai valu refer to section 14 3 on would expect red_max to give the maximum grai valu
