edu write gun buyback program will hopefulli have an impact on accident shoot especi youth domest disput where a gun is avail in the heat of emot and anger and mayb keep a few gun from be stolen and later us in street level crime what give you the idea that gun buyback program will have an impact on ani of these thing evid pleas pleas don t misinterret what i wa sai joe i wa make the point tha there is no evid of effect of gun buyback program but hopefulli if there is ani effect it mai prevent injuri or death in on of these type of common incid sai hopefulli the effect of polici x will be y is much differ from sai hopefulli if there is ani effect of polici x it will be y here you ve made both statement if the former describ a reason like outcom of polici x then perhap polici x is worthi of consider but the latter statement is not someth to base polici decis on firearm ar the fifth lead caus of unintent death among children ag 14 and under accord to group like the center to prevent handgun violenc formerli the nation coalit to ban handgun interest name chang don t you think who includ murder and suicid by firearm in the lead caus of unintent death figur but don t includ murder and suicid by other mean as caus of unintent death can t you see past the bullshit i don t understand how the ratio to other accident death is import so gun don t kill as mani children as car accid what is the differ in sever between 1 000 death and 10 000 death i am not try to us accident gun relat death among children as a justif for gun control who need to be convinc that accident gun death of children is a seriou problem i assum that ani human person would be concern when ani 10 year old got hold of their parent gun from their bedroom drawer and accid blew awai on of their friend certainli accident death by ani caus ar seriou thing but the anti gun group insist over and over again that accident death by firearm is a stastic seriou problem and even if you don t us these death as a justif for gun control these group do i m sorri if i jump to conclus about your reason for mention accident death due to firearm be someth that warrant concern but in light of your statement that you ar a staunch support of gun control measur i think the conclus wa a reason on the fact remain that tragic though individu accident gun death mai be thei ar not a seriou problem statist speak pleas explain why you think symbol offer do good my point wa gun buyback program which ar almost alwai run by polic depart might i stress might do a littl i stress littl good by give peopl the impress that the polic ar attempt to respond to interperson gun violenc in a uniqu wai overal i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback program were us sorri if it wasn t clear to me i thought you were waffl on your view of buyback program with the talk of symbol offer and hopefulli prevent accid and heat of passion shoot i have to disagre on all these count i can t understand how a bui gun from peopl who aren t intend to misus them obvious those who want to us gun to commit crime aren t go to turn them in could be constru as a posit wai for polic to respond to interperson violenc i suggest you go back and look at wherev you saw these statist i suspect you ll find if you look carefulli that 135 000 is the number of student estim to have carri a weapon not necessarili a gun to school at least onc in the past year and not the number of student who carri a gun to school daili well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violenc what the peopl who publish figur sai that as mani children commit suicid by handgun alon each year as the fbi sai commit suicid by all method per year who do you think i should believ the peopl who call everyon up to ag 24 children when thei re scream about the carnag of our nation s children be caus by handgun or the center for diseas control ah ye the agenc that consid accident shoot of children to be such a statist problem that a state object in the healthi peopl 2000 document is to enact law in 50 state requir manufactur of handgun to make the handgun more difficult to fire minim the likelihood of accident or intent dscharg by children the agenc that fund the studi of dc which pronounc that the dc gun ban had save x live ye thei actual gave us a number on the basi of a look at the number of shoot rather than the rate of shoot it wasn t their fault that the popul of dc drop in their post law period if you look carefulli you will see that you greatli underestim the presenc of gun in the live of youth the cphv report that 135 000 youth bring gun to school daili and that 400 000 bring gun to school at least onc a year the cdc estim that 1 out 0f 25 high school student carri a gun to school at least onc in 1990 okai i ll conced i no longer have the number i onc read on these i ll retract my disput of your number howev i would be greatli interest in see how cphv and cdc came up with these number the cdc also sai that 1 2 million elementari ag latch kei children kid who come home from school to an empti hous have access to gun in their home what s thi got to do with anyth hell when i wa in elementari school i came home to an empti hous with gun in it why is thi a problem i didn t touch the gun i had been taught not to i had also been taught not to mess with the gasolin in the garag the fuse box the car the knive the oven and the tool the problem is not the gun it s the parent california school report a 200% increas in student gun confisc between 1986 and 1990 and a 40% increas between 1988 and 1990 florida report a 61% percent increas in gun incid in school between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 these ar the statist and what ar these state do with the kid thei find with gun noth no crimin prosecut no expuls in most case not even suspens thei take the gun slap the kid on the wrist sai ain t it aw and go on as if everyth s back to normal what s wrong with thi pictur okai mayb i word it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situat fortifi compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not sai that koresh had control over these children directli but i would hope that whatev messiah there is would not let innoc children die i don t think koresh wa the messiah either but isn t it obviou that if he believ the forc of evil were come to destroi him then he believ the children were much safer insid the compound i didn t sai he wa sane just that he behav in a pretti ration manner given what he thought wa go on he thought he had them in the on place where harm wouldn t come to them if as he claim he wa the messiah and peopl follow him as such why did he not tell their parent to free the children instead of let them burn aliv let s see you try to find the exit unbarricad them and flee a fire when you ve been kept awak for most of 50 dai by loudspeak and subject to six hour of tank knock in your wall and tear ga assault joe
