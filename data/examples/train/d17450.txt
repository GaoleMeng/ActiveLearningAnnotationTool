the dea and other organ would have the american peopl believ that we ar win the war on drug i m go to dispel the propaganda that the dea is put out by show you the drug war s real statu to help prove my assert i ve also post two articl from usa todai that clearli demonstr that drug us among certain ag group is on the rise if wod is work as we re led to believ then drug abus should have gone down substanti by now the realiti is is that it ha not gone down veri much if anyth substanc abus is on the rise i m also go to suppli a possibl solut to thi problem the follow text is an excerpt from an articl about rock music and pot entitl hello again mari jane which appear in the current issu of time magazin april 19 1993 p 59 law enforc offici sai pot advoc ar just blow smoke when thei talk about

7 40% crack 0 3 0 5 67% sourc univers of michigan institut for social research 1993 report we ar not win the war on drug i think you can see that on of the tactic that the dea emploi to give peopl the impress that the war on drug is be won is to select quot statist onli statist that support their content that drug us ha gone down the excerpt from time magazin that i includ in thi post is an excel exampl of how organ like the dea attempt to deceiv the public usag of on particular drug mai have gone down but at the same time usag of other drug mai have gone up a k a substitut also drug usag among on particular ag group mai have gone down but drug usag among anoth ag group mai have gone up therefor if on take a look at the big pictur take into consider all the statist then it s obviou that the so call war on drug is be lost perhap the drug war is be won as far as illeg drug go but if on factor in alcohol abus smoke and us of inhal then the magnitud of the drug problem in thi countri can then place in it true perspect for those of you who don t consid alcohol to be a drug then try drink a fifth of whiskei sometim and then come back and tell me that it s not a drug agenc like the dea onli go after illeg drug thi is on of the reason why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at prevent substanc abus peopl will mere switch to anoth drug if the on thei were us becom scarc or unpopular the solut to the drug abus problem in thi countri mai be to legal some not all drug whose toxic ha been shown to be within reason limit you won t drop dead after us it a few time and then coupl thi with a massiv drug educ program the reason why i think legal is part of the solut is becaus peopl seem to be abl to easili obtain drug despit the govern s effort to the contrari the monei spent on drug interdict could be spent more effect elsewher e g drug educ addition legal would reduc crime becaus the profit motiv would be taken out of drug traffick which often goe along with other kind of crime not to mention the fact that addict would have less reason to prei on innoc peopl for their monei and posess in order to support their expens habit legal would caus the street price of drug to fall substanti so drug would be much more afford to addict imho the wai to reduc substanc abus is to do to drug what ha been done to smoker make drug us social unaccept rather than try to emploi heavi hand law enforc and punish peopl by incarcer them as you alreadi know peopl in the u s smoke a lot less than thei us to thi reduct in the number of smoker ha been brought about by public awar campaign law restrict where peopl can light up warn label on cigarett packag taxat on tobacco in order to reduc consumpt and so on i propos that similar method be us to reduc substanc abus after legal ha been carri out thei ar as follow drug be sold must come with clear concis inform which state the possibl health hazzard involv with us thi product and recommend on how the drug should be us thing like dosag level and how long the drug should be us ought to accompani the packag the drug is contain in all drug should be tax at a rate that gener a lot of revenu but not so high as to encourag peopl to acquir drug through illeg channel part of the revenu collect from drug tax should be us to fund drug educ and law enforc make it a feloni to sell drug to minor peopl under the ag of 18 anyon can sell drug but thei must not dodg pai the tax on drug or sell drug with the warn inform absent failur to pai the appropi tax on drug or omit warn inform should also be a feloni establish a govern agenc whose job is to insur that the puriti and safeti of all drug is as high as possibl thi agenc would try to prevent peopl from get a hold of bad drug someth that is a fairli seriou problem now i m sure that mani of the thing i ve discuss in thi articl have been hash out befor in thi newsgroup nevertheless i thought it wa a good idea to give my two cent actual a buck and a half all at onc so you could get a good idea of where i current stand on wod go ahead and tear into my post i m sure there is someth in it that you mai wish to take a differ view on or flame btw i post the articl from usa todai to not onli help prove my assert but also to provid inform on lsd usag among youth someth which i notic some poster to thi group were interest in scott kennedi brewer and patriot befor david koresh is a cheap thug who interpret the bibl through the barrel of a gun atf spokesman after the atf is a cheap thug who interpret the constitut through the barrel of a gun me
