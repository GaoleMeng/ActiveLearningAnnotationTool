c wainwright eczcaw mip nott ac uk wrote i jim i alwai thought that homophob wa onli a word us at act up ralli i didn t beleiv real peopl us it let s see if we agre on the term s definit a homophob is on who activ and militantli attack homosexu becaus he is actual a latent homosexu who us hi hostil to conceal hi true orient sinc everyon who disapprov of or condemn homosexu is a homophob your implic is clear it must necessarili follow that all men ar latent homosexu or bisexu at the veri least crap crap crap crap crap a definit of ani type of phobe come from phobia an irrat fear of henc a homophob not onli in act up meet the word is appar in gener us now or perhap it isn t in the bibl wouldst thou prefer if i were to commun with thou in bilespeak doe an arachnophob have an irrat fear of be a spider doe an agoraphob have an irrat fear of be a wide open space do you understand english obvious someon who ha phobia will react to it thei will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possibl thei will either strike out or run awai or do gaybash occur becaus of natur process peopl who defin have homophobia will either run awai from gai peopl or caus them or themselv violenc isn t that what i said what ar you take issu with here your remark ar mere parenthet to mine and add noth us it would seem odd if homosexu had ani evolutionari function other than limit popul growth sinc evolut onli occur when the member of on gener pass along their trait to subsequ gener homosexu is an evolutionari deadend if i take your usag of the term homophob in the sens you seem to intend then all men ar realli homosexu and evolut of our speci at least is go nowher so everi time a man ha sex with a woman thei intend to produc children hmm no wonder the world is overpopul obvious you keep to the monti python song everi sperm is sacr and if as you sai it ha a purpos as a mean to limit popul growth then it is by your own arguement natur consid the context i m talk about an evolutionari function on of the most basic requir of evolut is that member of a speci procreat those who don t have no purpos in that context anoth point is that if the offspr of each gener is to surviv the particip of both parent is necessari a famili must exist sinc homosexu do not reproduc thei cannot constitut a famili sinc the major of humankind is part of a famili homosexu is an evolutionari abber contrari to natur if you will well if that is true by your own arguement homosexu would have vanish year ago due to non procreat also the parent from singl parent famili should put the babi out in the cold now co thei must by your arguement die by your argument homosexu is genet determin as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context mean i am talk about evolut the preserv of the speci the fundament premis of the whole process but it get wors sinc the overwhelm major of peopl actual prefer a heterosexu relationship homosexu is a social abber as well the homosexu eschew the biolog imper to reproduc and then the social imper to form and particip in the most fundament social element the famili but wait there s more read the abov i expect you to have at least ten children by now with the famili grow these dai sex is less to do with procreat admittedli without it there would be no on but more to do with pleasur in pre pill and pre condom dai if you had sex there wa the chanc of produc children these dai is just ain t true peopl can decid whether or not to have children and when soon thei will be abl to choos it s sex c but that s anoth arguement so it s more of a lifestyl decis again by your arguement sinc homosexu can not or choos not to reproduc thei must be akin to peopl who decid to have sex but not children both ar as unnatur as each other yet anoth non sequitur sex is an evolutionari function that exist for procreat that it is also recreat is incident that homosexu don t procreat mean that sex is onli recreat and noth more thei serv no evolutionari purpos sinc homosexu have come out the closet and have convinc some polici maker that thei have civil right thei ar now claim that their sexual is a prefer a life style an orient a choic that should be protect by law now if homosexu is a mere choic and if it is both contrari to natur and anti social then it is a pervers choic thei have even less credibl than befor thei becam promin peopl ar peopl ar peopl who ar you to tell anyon els how to live their life ar you god tm if so fanci a date here s pretti obviou dodg do you realli think you ve said anyth or do you just feel oblig to respond to everi statement i am not tell anyon anyth i am demonstr that there ar argument against the practic of homosexu provid it s a mere an altern lifestly that ar not homophob that on can reason call it pervers in a context even a atheist can understand i realiz of cours that thi come danger close to establish a valu and that atheist ar compel to object on that basi but if you ar to be consist you have no case in thi regard to character ani opposit to homosexu as homophob is to ignor some veri compel argument against the legitim of the homosexu life style but sinc the charg is onli intend to intimid it s realli just demogogueri and not to be taken serious fact is jim there ar far more persuas argument for suppress homosexu than those given but consid thi a start again crap all your argument ar base on outdat ideal likewis the bibl would ani honest christian condemn the ten gener spawn by a bastard to etern damnat or someon who crush hi peni either accid or not both ar in deuteronomi i m sure your comment pertain to someth but you ve disguis it so well i can t see what where did i mention ideal out date or otherwis your argument ar veri reactionari do you have anyth at all to contribut as to why homosexu should be exclud from particip in scout the reason ar the same as those us to restrict them from teach by their own logic homosexu ar deviat social and biolog sinc ani adult is a role model for a child it is incumb on the parent to ensur that the child be isol from those who would do the child harm in thi case harm mean primarili social though that could be extend easili enough you show me anyon who ha sex in a wai that everyon would describ as normal and will take of my hat puma basebal cap to you on man s meat is anoth man s poison what ha thi got to do with anyth would you pick a singl point that you find offens and explain your object i would realli like to believ that you can discuss thi issu intellig bill
