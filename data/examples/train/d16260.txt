evid pleas pleas don t misinterret what i wa sai joe i wa make the point tha there is no evid of effect of gun buyback program but hopefulli if there is ani effect it mai prevent injuri or death in on of these type of common incid if you re a research associ in urban child research then perhap you can comment for us on the ratio of the accident gun death rate to the rate of accident death from other singl caus follow that perhap with some sort of justif for the amount of effort that anti gunner spend try to convinc the countri that accident gun relat death among children in the u s is a seriou problem firearm ar the fifth lead caus of unintent death among children ag 14 and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accident death is import so gun don t kill as mani children as

gun death of children is a seriou problem i assum that ani human person would be concern when ani 10 year old got hold of their parent gun from their bedroom drawer and accid blew awai on of their friend ani death is seriou wanna discuss match control firearm relat unintent death among children ag 14 and under ar the fault of on or more neglig person not the gun did i sai that a child who unintention shoot someon is not neglig no i hate to repeat myself jim but like i told joe i wa not attempt in ani wai to justifi gun control you re right ani death is seriou that wa my point to joe who said that anti gunner try to convinv the countri that accident gun death relat to children ar a seriou problem i guess i assum everyon thought that it wa a problem no i don t want to discuss match control i don t equat a book of match to a load 9 millimet either don t confus the issu and pleas don t sai that tire old nra line gun don t kill peopl peopl kill peopl sure peopl can kill peopl without gun but easi access to gun make it a lot more conveni gun don t kill peopl peopl with easi access to gun kill peopl more than anyth gun buyback program ar symbol offer to the commun in that sens i think thei might do a littl good pleas explain why you think symbol offer do good my point wa gun buyback program which ar almost alwai run by polic depart might i stress might do a littl i stress littl good by give peopl the impress that the polic ar attempt to respond to interperson gun violenc in a uniqu wai overal i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback program were us provid fals hope then is the intent jim i m just sai how it is i m not sai if that is a good thing or not from the polic who i have talk with who run some of these gun buyback program i get the impress that thei realli think thei ar have an impact on the commun when i ask them if thei have an evaluatori compon to the program thei sai well no so in answer to your question no fals hope is not the intent i think the intent is to show folk that polic ar attempt to do someth to curb interperson gun violenc whether it effect or not look if you can t measur the impact of these program us some sort of pre test and post test evalu what is the point it must be symbol in natur the polic ar essenti sai look if you have a gun ly around and you don t want it we ll give you $50 for it becaus we care about the commun if you i and joe could think of a wai to measur the effect or ineffect of these program we could becom rich and famou i do know that the vast major of gun that ar us by youth or brought to school by youth on a daili basi about 135 000 youth ar obtain easili and quickli through a person friend or more often borrow from a parent without their knowledg i suggest you go back and look at wherev you saw these statist i suspect you ll find if you look carefulli that 135 000 is the number of student estim to have carri a weapon not necessarili a gun to school at least onc in the past year and not the number of student who carri a gun to school daili well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violenc or the center for diseas control if you look carefulli you will see that you greatli underestim the presenc of gun in the live of youth the cphv report that 135 000 youth bring gun to school daili and that 400 000 bring gun to school at least onc a year the cdc estim that 1 out 0f 25 high school student carri a gun to school at least onc in 1990 the cdc also sai that 1 2 million elementari ag latch kei children kid who come home from school to an empti hous have access to gun in their home california school report a 200% increas in student gun confisc between 1986 and 1990 and a 40% increas between 1988 and 1990 florida report a 61% percent increas in gun incid in school between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 these ar the statist 200% increas in california school eh gun control is work fine there i didn t anyth about gun control what ar you talk about thu will to follow a man who claim to be the messiah got new for you folk if the big chees wa on thi crazi planet of our present he would not be carri a gun or hold children when thei were in danger hold kid time for a realiti check son these kid were the children of the peopl insid who believ that the forc of evil were outsid wait to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believ as thei did okai mayb i word it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situat fortifi compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not sai that koresh had control over these children directli but i would hope that whatev messiah there is would not let innoc children die if as he claim he wa the messiah and peopl follow him as such why did he not tell their parent to free the children instead of let them burn aliv thank for the realiti check joe it been real so your religion is differ doe that make it hi wrong even assum koresh actual made that decis and the verdict is still out on that jim listen to me i said i m not religi whatsoev do you understand religion ha noth to do with thi i could care less what religion thei were okai to put children in that situat is wrong pure and simpl differ is good jim i am the most progress and divers person in the world but if differ is allow kid to be expos to tank and tear ga then ye jim differ is wrong
