from center for polici research cpr subject labour s enclav polici import labour s enclav polici in the occupi territori by israel shahak publ in middl east intern london 30 4 93 it is not difficult to discov israel s polici toward the palestinian at ani given time it can be easili infer from the fact on the ground and from the inform provid by the hebrew press there is on condit though the torrent of claptrap about the peac process must be total ignor as must israel s offici pronounc whole sole purpos is to distort realiti by concentr onli on the fact it wa earli appar that labour s polici were no differ from those of shamir but for their greater relianc on deceit and their more effect implement likud s polici were accur describ by ariel sharon in an articl accompani by a map in yediot aharonot last august the sharon plan envisag a divis of the west bank into seven and the gaza strip into four autonom palestinian enclav all of them under isra supervis the total area of these enclav amount to about 15 per cent of the territori the rest wa to be control by the isra settlement and the highwai built around the enclav the entir area around jerusalem from the outskirt of ramallah to the boundari of bethlehem ha alreadi been turn into a greater jerusalem where the arab inhabit local amount to small enclav surround by area occupi by isra settlement or reserv for them judg from labour s settlement polici it mai be assum that it mai content itself with a lesser number of arab enclav of a rather larger size than sharon had plan but the principl of surround the enclav by settlement strateg dispers along the highwai remain unchang labour plan onli four enclav in the west bank two in samaria and two in judea i e north and south of jerusalem respect and no more than two in the gaza strip in regard to greater jerusalem labour s polici hardli deviat from sharon s a saner version of likud polici as some isra correspond at onc realis labour polici were but a saner version of sharon s extravaganza last juli gideon eshet wrote in yediot aharonot that while bare a few month ago labour support the demand to freez all construct beyond the green line no specif decis to freez construct in the territori ha been taken and uzi benziman wrote in ha aretz that as far as can be judg on the basi of the intern polit discuss in jerusalem rabin intend to stick to likud s wai the two biggest enclav envisag by labour ar locat in samaria therefor the belt of settlement around the tran samaria highwai design to separ those enclav from each other is of paramount import accord to the latest data the percentag of isra settler in the entir west bank popul apart from east jerusalem is a mere 5 5 per cent but for the area around the tran samaria highwai the correspond figur is almost 20 per cent and it is increas steadili the situat in the settlement of the efrat block south of jerusalem design to sever the enclav around bethlehem from the on around hebron is pretti much the same the efrat block is now be connect with west jerusalem by a highwai the project is costli in the extrem becaus the highwai is design to bypass bethlehem by a sequenc of long tunnel the final decis to build thi highwai wa suspend until rabin s return from hi us visit in march the subsequ decis to renew it construct can be seen as us approv for the enclav plan as a whole process of impoverish the enclav plan impli deliber and steadi impoverish of the palestinian thi is well known in israel but ignor abroad by all who should be concern includ the plo in regard to the gaza strip the whole process wa best describ by ze ev shiff in ha aretz in march he mention have seen a pamphlet issu six year ago by the civil administr forecast the condit in the gaza strip under isra rule in 2000 hi analysi deserv to be quot extens we continu to steal the strip s water even though it qualiti deterior from year to year we continu to steal the strip s tini land resourc in order to found there more and more settlement as if we deliber want to make the inhabit despair and in their despair think in termw of have noth to lose it is by our own do that the strip s worker must now spend travel to their workplac almost as much time as thei spend work from the militari point of view we have kept control of no more than half the strip s area at an increasingli exorbit price in manpow and resourc about a year befor mosh aren left the defenc ministri i heard him sai that we should withdraw from the strip come what mai hi argument wa that israel sink into the strip ever deeper and deeper he told me he had propos thi to yitzhak shamir but he reject it yitzhak rabin reject it too enorm state support for the qatif block settler can also be cite as proof that the enclav plan is be implement the qatif block settlement found by the first rabin govern of 1974 77 ar intend to divid the gaza strip into two separ enclav efraim davidi of davar had data show how vital for isra thi enterpris is the qatif block is now produc 40 per cent of isra tomato destin for export and a substanti proport of cut flower he also deal with the subsidi the settler receiv consider augment by the present govern ow to them hous unit ar cheap the present govern doe not spare effort to recruit new settler to the block ani prospect settler will get a 95 per cent mortgag for hi hous on top of a grant of 18 000 shekel $6 500 such data show that israel s plan appli whether the palestinian of the gaza strip ar allow or forbidden to work in israel the econom motiv were explain by danni rubinstein in ha aretz in march from the econom viewpoint gaza could alreadi be seal off hermet and all the strip s worker could be bar from enter israel even though accur data is hard to come by it is indisput that dure the last two year the numb of gazan worker arriv daili to work in israel ha markedli decreas from 80 000 in the mid 80s to 40 000 todai but the decreas is not onli due to restrict impos on enter israel from gaza it is also due to the drastic curtail of demand for gazan labour in israel with unemploy in israel soar and the construct of apart block virtual halt the worker from gaza ar no longer realli need gaza s total depend the entir economi of the gaza strip is total depend on israel in recent year in the gaza strip there ha been an increas in sub contract work for isra factori mostli footwar and textil thousand of small workshop emploi an averag of four worker get their raw materi or unfinish product togeth with detail work instruct from isra factori rubinstein attribut thi develop to the fact that the averag wage in the gaza strip is mere 40 per cent of that in the west bank which in turn stand at half the averag wage in israel and besid the gazan employ doe not pai ani social secur for hi employe if the averag wage in the gaza strip is just a fifth of that in israel the profit of isra factori and even of palestinian sub contractor must be vast thei ar higher still when a gazan sub contractor provid labour to be perform at home with the famili s help the livelihood of ten of thousand of gazan depend on such sub contract work mani of them ar women and children paid about ten shekel $3 50 a dai which can last 12 hour or more there can be no doubt that profit from exploit cheap gazan labour ar on of the reason for the stubborn opposit of rabin and other isra minist to withdraw from the strip econom condit in the gaza strip differ littl from what wa creat straight after israel s conquest in 1967 in thi respect on should not be delud by the talk nowadai fashion about isra gestur intend to encourag econom develop in the territori as isra journalist point out all permit for open new busi depend on a prior approv by the shin bet behind all the profess goodwil there is no desir to solv problem just the attitud of a good colonialist will to do someth for the benefit of the nativ but on condit that thei behav nice do not becom rebelli and never do anyth against the interest of the metropoli it econom interest includ wrote michal sela in davar in februari the develop of sub contract work in the gaza strip accord perfectli with sela s diagnosi sela also show how exactli the econom control work in all branch of the economi lobbi have been set in motion for purpos of free isra product from the threat of ani palestinian competit the method is simplic itself as soon as ani isra produc succe in persuad the govern or even the trade and industri minist alon a militari order is issu prohibit the export of a given produc to israel if thi doe not suffic a palestinian factori mai be deni a licenc to oper or bureaucrat obstacl mai paralys it product among the most activ of such lobbi is the agricultur on it ha succeed in limit export of gazan veget except for those grown by settler not onli to israel but also to europ where thei otherwis might compet with isra export perpetuar apartheid labour s goal is to perpetu thi apartheid regim in the territori the same goal is share by the us which otherwis could not support the labour govern so firmli in my view on of the reason the us feel happier about support labour than likud is it greater effici in pursu the settlement drive thi point wa brought home by ofer shelah in ma ariv who deplor the settler failur which he attribut to likud s ineffici he show that the peak yearli settlement growth occur dure the term of offic of the nation uniti govern i e 1984 90 in which rabin serv throughout as the defenc minist likud s reput for settl the

that of likud primarili in the effici with which it is implement accord to that polici the territori ar to be divid into two part the major part is to be rule by israel directli and the minor part indirectli in my view thi racist scheme is doom to ultim fail but at a horrifi price in human suffer the sooner it true natur is recognis the less suffer it mai caus
