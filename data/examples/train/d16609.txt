number of individu which were tri in secret and for which their ident the date of their trial and their imprison ar state secret apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind close door there wa on other espionag case the nutti professor at the ne ziona biolog institut who wa a k g b mole who wa tri in camera i wouldn t exactli call it a state secret the trial wa simpli tri behind close door i hate to disappoint you but the unit state ha tri a number of espionag case in camera at issu wa not a trial behind close door but arrest trial and imprison in complet secreci thi wa appraent attempt in the case of vanunu and fail it ha happen befor and there is reason to believ it still goe on read thi from ma ariv februari 18 possibl 28 1992 public ban the state of israel ha never offici admit that for mani year there have been in it prison isra citizen who were sentenc to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which thei were accus ever be made public by baruch me iri all those involv in thi matter polit refus my request on wai or anoth look the subject is too delic if i comment on it i will be implicitli admit that it is true if i mention a specif case even hint at it i might be guilti of make public someth which mai legal not be publish the state of israel ha never offici admit that for mani year there have been in it prison isra citizen who were sentenc to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which thei were accus ever be made public more precis a court order public ban wa place on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprison in israel of 1993 citizen ar imprison without us the citizen of thi countri know anyth about it not know anyth about the fact that on person or anoth were tri and thrown in prison for secur offens in complet secreci in the distant past for exampl dure the dai of the lavon ya affair we heard about the third man be in prison but mani year have pass sinc then and what exist then can todai no longer be found even in south american countri or in the former communist countri but it appear that thi is still possibl in israel of 1993 the chair of the knesset committe on law the constitut and justic mk david zucker sent a letter on thi subject earli thi week to the prime minist the minist of justic and the cabinet legal advisor ma ariv ha obtain the content of the letter dure the past sever year a number of isra citizen have been imprison for variou period for secur offens in some of these case a legal public ban wa impos not onli on the specif of the crime for which the prison were convict but even on the mere fact of their imprison in those case after be legal convict the prison spend their term in prison without public awar either of the imprison or of the prison assert mk zucker on the other hand zucker agre in hi letter that there is absolut no question that it is possibl and in some case it is imper that a public ban be impos on the specif of secur offens and the cours of trial but even in such case the court must weigh carefulli and deliber the circumst under which a trial will not be held in public howev on must ask whether the imposit of a public ban on the mere fact of a person s arrest and on the name of a person sentenc to prison is justifi and appropri in the state of israel the principl of public trial and the right of the public to know ar not consist with the disappear of a person from public sight and hi descent into the abyss of prison zucker thu decid to turn to the prime minist the minist of justic and the cabinet legal advisor and request that thei consid the question the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incur by abid by the principl of public punish the state of israel cannot be allow to have prison whose detent and it caus is kept secret wrote zucker the legal counsel of the civil right union attornei mordechai shiffman said that we as the civil right union do not know of ani case of secur prison citizen of israel who ar imprison and whose imprison cannot be made public thi is a situat which if it actual exist is definit unhealthi just like censorship is an unhealthi matter the union is awar sai shiffman of case where notif of a suspect s arrest to famili member and lawyer is withheld i am speak onli of sever dai i know also of case where a detaine wa not allow to meet with an attornei sometim for the whole first month of arrest that is done becaus of the great secreci the suspect himself hi famili hi lawyer or even a journalist can challeng the public ban in court but there ar case where the famili member themselv ar not interest in public the journalist know noth of the arrest and so almost everyon is happi attornei yossi arnon an offici of the bar claim that given the law as thei exist in israel todai a situat where the arrest of a person for secur offens is kept secret is definit possibl noth is easier the court order a public ban and that s that someon who ha commit secur offens can spend long year in prison without us know anyth about it do you find thi situat accept attornei arnon definit not we live in a democrat countri and such a state of affair is impermiss i am well awar that public can be damag from the standpoint of secur but total non public silenc is unaccept consid the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in hi case we know that he wa charg with aggrav espionag and sentenc to 18 year in prison the trial wa held behind close door nobodi knew the detail except for those who were author to it is somehow possibl to understand though not to accept the reason but as i have note we at least ar awar of hi imprison why is the matter actual that seriou can t we trust the discret of the court attornei arnon the judg have no choic but to trust the present made to them the judg do not have the tool to investig thi give the govern enorm power power which thei can misus and what if there realli is a secur issu attornei arnon i am a man of the legal system not a secur expert democraci stand in opposit to secur i believ it is possibl to public the matter of the arrest and the charg without enter into detail we have alreadi seen how the law concern public ban can be misus in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder wa held for mani month without the matter be made public attornei shiffman on the other hand believ that state secur can be a legitim reason for prohibit public of a suspect s arrest or of a convict crimin s imprison a healthi situat definit not but i am awar of the fact that mere public mai be harm to state secur a differ opinion is express by attornei uri shtendal former advisor for arab affair to prime minist levi eshkol and golda meir clearli we ar speak of isol special case such situat contrast with the principl that a judici proceed must be held in public no doubt thi contradict the principl of freedom of express definit also to the principl of individu freedom which is also harm by the prohibit of public nevertheless add shtendal the legisl allow for the possibl of such a ban to accommod special case where the damag possibl as a consequ of public is greater than that which mai follow from an abridg of the principl i ve mention the author to decid such matter of public doe not rest with the prime minist or the secur servic but with the court which we mai rest assur will author a public ban onli if it ha been convinc of it need beyond a shadow of a doubt nevertheless attornei shtendal agre as a rule clearli such a phenomenon is undesir such an extrem step must be taken onli in the most extrem circumst yigal aren usc isi tv made me do it aren isi edu
