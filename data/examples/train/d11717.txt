in articl 1993apr22 163605 24784 csu edu kschang sfsuvax1 sfsu edu kuo sheng kasei chang write there ar sever type of copi protect and the point is to make sure the user is us a legitim copi the simplest and virtual fool proof wai is for the program to somehow fixat itself to the machin it wa instal on some sort of checksum serial number whatev so a copi put on a differ machin not instal from origin disk will not work okai so what do you do if some part of the machin presum the part on which the code number or whatev that the program ha fixat itself upon goe bad you replac that part and now your program won t run becaus it s on a differ comput thi is of cours assum that the program us someth in rom like the bio serial number mayb and not a disk base code number obvious if the drive goe bad you ll be reinstal the stuff anywai i work in a comput lab which is part of the univers microlab system we have the wonderfulli fun task of maintain well over a hundr machin both pc and macintosh as well as administ a network of over 50 next machin i person am concern onli with a small lab with ten pc s and ten mac s i m not the manag but help him with admin often imho copi protect scheme of ani sort ar noth more than a major headach for the legitim user anyon who want a copi of your program and doesn t care about legal will get a copi period pirat board or no pirat board i too have friend who blatantli and quit successfuli hack copi protect scheme practic in their sleep let s consid what goe on in our lab almost daili we have at least on machin down sometim sever due to some goofbal screw up some set or other on a piec of softwar admittedli we be student mostli ar not the world s most effici and effect network administr but we try keep even the twenti machin that ar partli my respons even vagu look and act similar to the averag user and maintain behind the scene consist is a real headach but not so bad a headach as try to rememb twenti differ folder locat of norton util when some gui trash hi disk often we have hardwar problem at peak busi time and have to do some part swap to get stuff work temporarili well i ll cut to the chase and quit bore y all the point is often we have to re instal softwar and copi configur file etc from machin to machin by far the easiest wai we have found to do thi is to get on machin work exactli the wai we want to then copi the complet setup of thi machin to the other nine of that machin s type thi ensur us that for at least ten minut we have ten ident machin to work with have them network simplifi thi consider as our major packag wordperfect window etc ar all network version and thu onli on copi to mess with often howev we need to instal a packag request by some instructor to on some or all of the machin for a special project thi is usual a hand written or sharewar etc program similar to what i believ the origin poster wa ask about the few we have had with copi protect scheme have caus noth but nightmar for us to maintain in short don t wast your time with a copi protect scheme it s sort of like outlaw gun the crimin will get your program anywai and you will onli be hurt the legitim honest user write a good user s guid and tech manual whatev els for your program pleas do thi regardless of whether you copi protect the thing and onli distribut the manual to licens user jack the price to cut your loss but pleas take a cue from the major compani who can admittedli afford the cost of illeg copi far better than you and don t burden the legitim user with a copi protect scheme sorri for the tirad but it s been a long dai here mark s underwood ee student univers of kentucki lab assist boyd hall microlab a tini littl divis of uk librari microlab e mail msund01 mik uki edu the program is definit backup if restor to the same machin depend on the programm don t us a disk drive characterist if the user did an upgrad to the machin he she should reinstal all program ani wai no document look up no disk wear and tear i did not sai that the origin would allow onli on instal the user s conscienc should do that i know i ll get flame for thi but with the increas number of casual user who either unknowingli or don t care about the softwar copyright it s the truth i have friend who ask me for copi of my latest game all the time and when i refus thei went after somebodi els casual pirat is becom more of a problem some sort of copi protect will discourag the casual copi i ve seen what some of my friend dug up somewher latest and the greatest game all crack within dai of actual releas you know how mani byte you need to chang in x wing to disabl the quiz two ye two and don t ask me which on thei ar determin pirat ar unstopp given enough time but their result do not spread that far sinc pirat board ar not that well known and easili track onc found by author it is the casual pirat that the copi protect is determin to discourag what i believ the compani should do is implement the abov plu a special patch onc the user regist that loudli exclaim upon bootup regist to xxxxx address citi state zip and disabl the abov two benefit 1 encourag registr 2 cut down on pirat and make it more traceabl becaus if the patch s registr messag is encrypt it will be quit hard to chang and therefor provid a stabl trail of who allow their copi out of their hand and thu violat their licens agreement thi wai the legitim user who doe not regist will experi minim discomfort who doe major upgrad to their comput frequent as onli problem thei have is thei won t be abl to restor to anoth comput the regist user would have proven thei ar legitm user and therefor gain full right and can restor to differ machin on the other hand the softwar compani now have a record of where thi particular copi is suppos to be if thi user s copi wa found to be somewher it wa not suppos to be we know who ha broken their licens agreement of cours a hacker can break that eventu but that s not the point is it kasei chang
