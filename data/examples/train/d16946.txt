cvill srv wam umd edu aap wam umd edu alberto adolfo pinka write i do not want to convinc anyon thi is just usenet not the real world i just read the opinion other have about a subject and sometim i present my opinion i think that thi net is onli us to exchang idea i never want nor i want now to convinc anyon of anyth fine now if your opinion isn t convinc anyon and it s get refut regularli by the fact which is the case isn t it like that your opinion need some revis as i said i do not want to convic anyon so why should my opinion convinc anyon i do not believ that my opinion ar refut by fact then you haven t been pai attent to the argument level against them thei have been over and over again thei will be again first and i repeat it i never said that the idea of jew have the right to have a state is racist zionism as a movement is more than just that idea in a word utter and complet hors puckei look the term up in the dictionari mayb youi view of a dictionari is the problem here on thing is the accept mean of a word by a dictionari and sometim a complet differ thing is what that word came to mean after a long time hei what do you think dictionari ar for you quit obvious need on a good dictionari give both and you well know it i think that zionism in the wai it defin who is a jew for exampl is racist like ok now how would you defin it and by the wai you re wrong again there is no uniform of thi definit among zionist movement you know thi is the case it s been point out on the net directli to you befor and yet you continu to maintain thi delus ok tell me how mani peopl in zionist movement defin a jew in a differ wai and how mani ar who defin jew base on a religi wai i don t think that data exist on thi directli in the same wai i believ that irish have a right to nation but i do not support the bomb and kill of the ira i believ that jew have a right to nation but i do not support zionism as it is right now compar the action of israel to that of the ira is like compar those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for exampl with the ira in the role of pinochet you realli need to get your histori straight you also need a basic dictionari you need to start read befor answer my point wa that becaus some movement claim to be nationalist it doe not mean that i consid it to be nationalist i did not comapr israel to the ira i think that you ar start to put word on my mouth and that is wrong that is no problem but onc again you ar defin zionism as on movement you ar impli that it is monolith you know thi is not and ha never been the case stuff delet by pinka hi statement which i wa respond to with the below assert that zionism wa uniform and monolith i never said that zionism is monolith if you ar go to attribut me thing present the quot where i said that you don t sai it directli you impli it and i show explicitli where and how you impli it now you re try to wriggl out of it won t wash and you know it that is what make the basi for zionist movement howev i am not consid just that but the rest of it in a word i don t believ you your word tell a veri differ stori especi sinc thei ar not base on fact but innuendo and misrepresent that is your problem i could certainli interpret thi like you ar run out of argument first you put word in my mouth now you sai you do ot believ me it s you not me who is run out of argument which make an interest point peopl live in a jewish state have shown that jewish cultur includ in it jewish religion but thei ar not the same so the jewish peopl live in the jewish state have shown us that there ar some problem in a state where 80% of the peopl is secular but judaism is defin accord to religi standard or where marriag is a religi stage or where the law of return defin a jew accord to a religi standard no it doesn t nowher doe the law of return demand that on must be religi or even believ in g d to becom a citizen of israel thereund why don t you try read for a chang did i sai that the law of return demand a person to be religi now how doe the law of return defin who is a jew and who is not i said that it us a religi standard if your mother is a jew you ar a jew if your mother is not jewish neither you ar do not twist my word pleas what you said is that judaism is defin accord to religi standard now thi can have sever differ mean and you know it on of the mean that it can have is to sai that onli those who ar religi ar defin as jew anoth is to sai that onli those who meet the religi definit of a jew is on and there ar other i m not twist your word i m try to make you awar that your word don t mean what you think thei do true there ar debat in israel and abroad about who is a jew but those debat ar taken up by both religi and secular would you sai that religi peopl should not have a sai in that would you deni them their right of free speech i am not talk about the debat i am talk about how thing ar right now when the debat is over i ll see what happen right now thing ar like thei ar let me ask you on thing i understand that israel differenci between citizenship and nation suppos m al and f emal have a child in israel which nation will the child s id show accord to each on of the follow case actual it doesn t and the citizen right ar exactli the same in both case anywai a f and m ar both jewish jewish b f is jewsh and m is not jewish c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish it ll depend on what religion is practic in the hous the origin law of return would still admit such a person if thei were jewish if memori serv e f and m ar both non jewish not jewish did those isra who do not believ in god and will never do becom non jew why should thei still defin then a jew base on what is a religi definit it s call histori how do you think jew stuck togeth through pogrom for millenia in europ we had to know who wa our own i for on do think that some chang is in order and that patrilin descent is no less legit than is matrilin which is not the religi jew s point of view there s plenti of room for that in zionism as you well know it call histori at some point it wa ok now i believ it is not that s valid as far as i can see accord to webster s ninth new collegi dictionari merriam webster inc publish springfield massachusett u s a 1986 page 593 hy poc ri sy a feign to be what on is nnot or to believ on doe not so sai that on believ in zionism as a simpl matter of peopl have the right to nation but disregard the right of the palestinian peopl to do the same accord to thi dictionari is hypocrisi utter balonei by the wai i do believ the palestinian have a right to self determin have state so on thi net and i know you ve seen it interest how do you know had i ever talk to you about thi and forgotten about that more than onc as have other but that right to self determin cannot be at israel s expens israel s secur come first and that secur must be maintain you re also twist word now beyond belief if you think that s what that definit mean in thi context you need a first grade cours in english which definit ar you now talk here about the veri on you give abov it is absolut inconsist with the twist you put on it i do not know why you ar so touchi i never said that you did not support palestinian self determin i just gave an exampl of hypocrisi no you didn t you had to twist the definit of the word 180 degre in order to do so and everyon els know it i m not be touchi i never said that someon in thi net is guilti of it it wa just an exampl noth more noth less than that why did you have to clarifi what you think becaus what you gave wa not an exampl it wa an exampl of how the definit of a word can be twist around 180 degre if you didn t us differ mean of word than ar in the dictionari you might be believ here you have sever problem first you should know that word have more mean than those given in the dictionari oh so now what ar dictionari for second it mai come to be a shock for you to know that there ar more word than those in the dictionari duh as a scientist whose technic term ar veri often not found in common dictionari i know thi but when a term is common like hypocrisi a good dictionari can be regard as an authorit sourc third we can exchang idea if you want but you come out with thi nonsens about be believ us the definit given in a dictionari it s not nonsens when peopl read what you write thei have to try to associ a mean to those word dictionari give the mean of word don t thei now i assum that you d like to have the word you us mean what you d like them to but the fact is you re us veri differ mean than ar in the dictionari or you would like the reader to assign them new mean which thei never had it seem that you cannot answer to the idea given by other without insult other sad not at all what i cannot abid is utter bombast when you ve been proven complet wrong if your fact at all resembl even the slightest bit of truth which thei do not you might be believ if you did not put word in my mouth it might be that you might start read what i had actual said i never put even on syllabl in your mouth you have tri to prove thi and you fail so far you come over and over twist what i said or present thing i never said as if i had said them poppycock in thi wai you ar answer to yourself that is why you do not find it believ mayb if you start read what i had actual said and not what you ad you might chang your mind i read what you said i did not add anyth you simpli either don t know that the word don t mean what you d like them to which cannot be the case now sinc you ve been proven wrong and you quit obvious don t have a defens against the argument present or you re twist the mean which is it but the fact is that there is noth resembl fact in what you ve said on thi thread and the fact also is that you re us differ definit for your word base on balonei than anyon els doe first there is noth resembl a fact in what you ad to what i said as if i had said it ha there s noth resembl fact in what you ve said i never ad anyth to what you said how sad to see a model of decorum and tranquil becom like ani other sport a battleground for rival ideolog to slug it out with glee tim rice chess eric s perlman
