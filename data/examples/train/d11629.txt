i have a new scope and i thought i d save a few buck by bui on with a function gener built in after have it awhil i notic two thing about the function gener for on there seem to be a bia even when the pull offset is push in that is i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal san some random 50mv bia the other _realli_ annoi thing is that the damn output won t go below about 1v p p i am a student you mai have guess from my previou post and i often have to measur the input imped of variou circuit i build mani of the circuit have maximum input signal of wai less than 500mv amplitud and most have input imped in the 10 s of kohm rang the thing is in order to us my function gener i have to divid the voltag to some thing reason then of cours to measureth input imped of my circuit i am go to have to throw in anoth resistor in seri with the 50ohm output of the gener i could just ignor it but now with thi littl divid there i have to figur that in it s kind of a pain in the ass is there ani wai i could make myself a littl box that could solv thi littl problem the box would tkae the function gener input lower the voltag and give an output imped that is some low unchang number i would want to lower the voltag by a factor of on hundr or so i could just build a littl buffer amp but i d like to have thi box not be activ ani quick idea the scope s not broken for other reason i had sent it to the shop to get repair and thei replac it the function gener wa the same wai on that on too pleas help as i am feel veri stupid todai dave dgj2y virginia edu
