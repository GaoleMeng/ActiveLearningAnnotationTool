featur at thi point most respond have agre upon twm as the best candid for a speedi window manag a coupl of gener trick you can try to soup up your window manger is turn off unnecessari thing like zoom and opaqu move also if you lai out your window in a tile manner you reduc the amount of cpu power spent in rais and lower overlap window joe english joe trystero art com i ve found that a good font for tile is 7x13 aka misc fix medium r normal 13 100 100 100 c 70 iso8859 1 it is the biggest font i know of that i can us on my sun 1152x900 screen and still get two 80 column termin window side by side on the displai with no overlap other font suggest will be accept the x server which server make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardwar if you have a monochrom monitor us a monochrom x11 server on my monochrom sun i haven t notic much differ between the xsun colour server and xsunmono howev it wa point out to me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefor should contribut to less page thank to jonni farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk michael salmon michael salmon eo ericsson se how your server wa compil can also make a differ jeff law law schirf cs utah edu advis us that on a sun system x should be compil with gcc version 2 or with the unbundl sun compil you can expect to get veri larg speedup in the server by not us the bundl suno compil i assum that similar result would occur if you us on of the other high qualiti commerci compil on the market lock the server into ram ha anyon tri hack the x server so that it is lock into ram and doe not get page eg via a call to plock doe thi help perform at all i ve had on inquiri on thi topic and a few pointer to the plock function call but no hard evid from someon who s tri it i am not in a posit to give it a try thank to eric c claei ecc eperm att com danni backx db sunbim be juan d martin juando cnm us es start your server joe english joe trystero art com if you start up a lot of client in your xsession or whatev sleep for a second or two after launch each on after i chang my xclient script to do thi log in actual took less time we have a heavili load system without much core though thi sound crazi but i have confirm that it work warner losh imp solbourn com provid me with a good explan of why thi work which i have summar here when you start up an x server it take a huge amount of time to start accept connect a lot of initi is done by the server when it start thi process touch a larg number of page ani other process run at the same time would fight the server for us of the cpu and more importantli memori if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chanc to get itself sort out befor the client start up similarli there is also a lot of initi whenev an x client program start toolkit regist widget resourc be fetch program initi state and databas and so forth all thi activ is typic memori intens onc thi initi is done the process ha reach a steadi state the memori usag typic settl down to us onli a few page by us sleep to stagger the launch of your client in your xinitrc you avoid them fight each other for your workstat s limit resourc thi is most definit a your mileag mai vari situat as there ar so mani variabl to be consid avail ram local swap space load averag number of user on your system which client you ar start etc current in my xinitrc i have a situat like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm i ve experi with sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 2 exec xbiff sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm i ve even tri sleep 2 exec start_x_client_script and then in start_x_client_script i had sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm the idea with thi last on wa to make sure that xinit had complet finish process my xinitrc and had settl down into a steadi state befor the sleep expir and all my client were launch all of these yield fairli compar result and so i just stuck with my current setup for it simplic you will probabl have to experi a bit to find a setup which suit you font load font take time and ram if you minim the number of font your applic us you ll get speed increas in load up time on simpl strategi is to choos a small number of font on small on larg on roman whatev suit you and configur all your client or at least all your heavili us client to us onli those few font client program should start up quicker if their font is alreadi load into the server thi will also conserv server resourc sinc fewer font will be load by the server farrel mckai fbm ptcburp ptcbu oz au joe english joe trystero art com eg my main xterm font is 7x13 so i also have twm set up to us 7x13 in all it s menu and icon etc twm s default font is 8x13 sinc i don t normal us 8x13 i ve elimin on font from my server oliv jone oj roadrunn pictel com keep font local to the workstat rather than load them over nf if you will make extens us of r5 scalabl font us a font server about the resourc file keep your xresourc xdefault file small save ram and save on server startup time joe english joe trystero art com on suggest in your xdefault xresourc file try put onli the minimum number of resourc that you want to have avail to all of your applic for exampl reversevideo true then separ your resourc into individu client specif resourc file for exampl $home lib app default in your login file set the environ variabl xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath $home lib app default %n the comp window x frequent ask question faq contain an excel explan of how these environ variabl work ed so when xterm launch it load it resourc from app default xterm xdvi find them in app default xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all client follow the same xxxxx resourc file name pattern you can check in your system app default directori often usr x11r5 lib x11 app default to find the proper name and then name your person resourc file with the same name thi is all document in the xt specif pg 125 666 thank to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel ee cornel edu kevin is will mail hi setup file to inquir thi method of organ your person resourc ha the follow benefit easier to maintain more usabl fewer resourc ar store in the x server in the resourc_manag properti as a side benefit your server mai start fraction quicker sinc it doesn t have to load all your resourc applic onli process their own resourc never have to sort through all of your resourc to find the on that affect them it also ha drawback the applic that you ar interest in ha to load an addit file everi time it start up thi doesn t seem to make that much of a perform differ and you might consid thi a huge boon to usabl if you ar modifi an applic s resourc databas you just need to re run the applic without have to xrdb again xrdb will by default run your xdefault file through cpp when your resourc ar split out into multipl resourc file and then load by the individu client program thei will not watch out for thi i had c style comment in my xdefault file which cpp strip out when i switch to thi method of distribut resourc file i spent sever frustrat dai try to figur out why my client were not find their resourc xt did not provid ani error messag when it encount the c style comment in the resourc file it simpli silent abort process the resourc file the loss of preprocess which can be veri handi e g ifdef color is enough to caus some peopl to dismiss thi method of resourc manag you mai also run into some client which break the rule for exampl neither emac 18 58 3 nor xvt 1 0 will find their resourc if thei ar anywher other than in xdefault when start up a client on a machin that doe not share file with the machin where your resourc ar store your client will not find it resourc load all your resourc into the server will guarante that all of your client will alwai find their resourc casei leedom casei gauss llnl gov a possibl compromis suggest that i have and am plan on try is to put resourc for all my heavili us client eg xterm into my xdefault file and to us the separ resourc file method for client that i seldom us defin your displai properli client program ar often execut on the same machin as the server in that situat rather than set your displai environ variabl to hostnam 0 0 where hostnam is the name of your workstat you should set your displai variabl to unix 0 0 or 0 0 by do thi you access optim routin that know that the server is on the same machin and us a share memori method of transfer request thank to patrick j horgan pjh70 ra amdahl com see the _displai name_ section of the x 1 man page for further explan of how to properli set your displai name i don t think it s stock mit but at least data gener and hp have librari that ar smart enough to us local commun even when the displai isn t set special rob sartin 88opensi sartin uunet uu net jodi goldberg jodi algorithm com sent me an xlib patch to chang stock r5 to us local commun even if displai is not properli set i don t want to get in the busi of distribut or try to juggl non mit patch and so have elect not to includ it here hopefulli mit will appli thi minor 8 line patch themselv in the meantim if you want to try it yourself email jodi ed client if you onli have a few megabyt of ram then you should think carefulli about the number of program you ar run think also about the _kind_ of program you ar run for exampl is there a smaller clock program than xclock unfortun i haven t realli notic that program advertis how larg thei ar so the onu is on us to do the research and spread the word suggest on better altern to the some of the standard client eg xclock xterm xbiff ar welcom ed i ve receiv some contradictori advic from peopl on the subject of x client program some advoc the us of program that ar strictli xlib base sinc xt xaw and other toolkit ar rather larg other warn us that other applic which you ar us mai have alreadi load up on or more of these share librari in thi case us a non xt for exampl client program mai actual _increas_ the amount of ram consum the upshot of all thi seem to be don t mix toolkit that is try and us just athena client or just xview client or just motif client etc if you us more than on then you re drag in more than on toolkit librari know your environ and think carefulli about which client program would work best togeth in that environ thank to rob sartin 88opensi sartin uunet uu net duncan sinclair sinclair dc gla ac uk sinclair uk ac gla dc a better clock
