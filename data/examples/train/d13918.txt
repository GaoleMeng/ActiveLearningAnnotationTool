well i seem to have struck an interest discuss off given that i am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i ll have to boil it down a bit 1 all the data on burst to date show a smooth random distribut 2 that mean thei aren t concentr in galact core our or someon els 3 if the distribut is smooth we ar either see some enorm larg phenomena scatter at the edg of the univers said phenomena be subject to debat almost as vioent as the phenomena or we ar see some phenomena out at like the oort cloud but then it need some potent littl energi sourc that isn t detect by ani other current method 4 we know it s not real close like slightli extra solar becaus we have no parallax measur on the burst 5 the burst seem to bright to be someth like black hole quanta or super string impact or someth like that so everyon is watch the data and argu like mad in the meanwhil what i am wonder is thi in peopl s opinion a new physic problem einstein got well known for solvingth photoelectr effect copernicu start look at irregular in planetari motion is thi a big enough problem to creat a new area of physic just a littl specul think folk pat
