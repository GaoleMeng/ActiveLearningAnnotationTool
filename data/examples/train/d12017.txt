andi collin acollin uclink berkelei edu wrote on not so quick question to throw out there for you gui for our class project we need to design and build a power suppli to the follow spec voltatg adjust from 1 12v current limit at 1a voltag must stai within 2% of design valu for i from 0 1a ac rippl less than 5 mv rm to decid which kind of circuit you must know the initialpreciss of the limit current and the allow temp drift in the first case you can us a ub of a transistor as a voltag refer of about 0 7 vdc with a temp drift of 2mv k in the second case it better you us a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum current the output of thi opamp control the outputstag to limit the current bye thoma
