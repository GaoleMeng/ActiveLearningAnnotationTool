ye everyon seem to be in agreement that the yanke ar final move in the right direct thei should finish over 500 thi year and mayb even be in the pennent race in august howev i would take back a few move 1 the jim abbott trade i think abbott is not onli an inspir person but a great pitcher also he could win the cy young thi year but he won t becaus the right side of the yank infield isn t good enough so why wa thi not a good trade jt snow how mani rooki have been abl to step in and immedi have the impact that he ha had so far on the angel i know it s earli but if you ve seen thi kid hit field or talk you can just tell that he is go to be a tremend player the yank should have kept him what about mattingli you ask well it s great that the yank have taken care of him and remain loyal but he s 10 year older than snow and just doesn t have the same bat speed as befor hi back injuri it s a shame but as a yanke fan who want to see the best yanke team i d take snow over mattingli at first the yank also gave up two promis propect with snow for abbott besid with domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterl hitchcock thei ar just load with propect i know abbott onli 26 but thi wa too much to give up i believ georg forc thi trade becaus he believ and he s right that abbott will be a big hit in ny howev i d like to see the yanke build a basebal team not an amus show 2 wade bogg i live in boston and like wade a lot but hi career is wind down and i would rather see the yank start to develop a long term solut i e henslei muelin russ davi velard besid wade just doesn t have ani rang what a shame about charli hay huh 3 spike owen see wade bogg i d much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever wade and spike next to each other in the infield is go to rais the yanke staff era 1 2 point and these gui ar on the down side of their career 4 danni tartabul ye he s put up some tremend number and it s nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthi all year but he never is we should expect 120 game max out of him meanwhil gerald william is plai at columbu and paul o neil is plai left field i believ o neil led nl outfield in assist last year and tartabul is a poor defens outfield what i m basic get at is the yank ar move in the right direct but ar not readi to win a pennent thi year thei should at the gm level be plan for a 1994 or 1995 world seri thi mean get the younger player experi in the major now so thei will be readi in a year or two i m afraid that all thi stuff wreak of georg steinbrenn certainli the bogg deal wa all georg it look like georg is plan the right mix of veteran and young player to win a world seri now the veteran ar alwai avail and can be ad at ani time like boston did thi year develop the young player first then add the on or two veteran or in the yanke case just keep them let s all us yanke fan hope that georg doesn t dismantl the terrif job stick and compani have done build the yanke organ back into on of respect i m realli afraid that he will trade whoever it take to patch hole todai relief pitch for exampl georg must realiz that the yanke rebuild process is still on or two year awai have patienc georg and we will all enjoi the futur fire bucki and trade the kid and it s basebal hell for all loyal yanke fan for a long time sam i m not militello or millitello mandelbaum
