most of thi discuss ha been between mark singer and david tate with valentin weigh in on the same side as dave at variou time my opinion fwiw to all mark ag doesn t matter abil doe i would rather have the untri rooki with great minor leagu number than the veteran who ha proven himself to be averag at best i don t care if he is 15 if he plai better than what i have i want him out there sandi alomar had decent minor leagu number grossli inflat by the pcl in gener and la vega in particular he should have been project as an averag major leagu hitter which is good for a catcher i ll admit santiago s number would probabl come out the same as sandi s but i don t have the leagu data from the mid 80s to check it out that be said i agre with send lopez to richmond at least to start the season as the box below show he ha on minor leagu season in which he hit well he ha two in which he hit veri veri poorli i want to see that the 92 lopez is real olson and berryhil ar not complet mediocr for catcher especi nl catcher thei ar essenti averag hitter with equival averag around 220 if he had hit well at prior level i would sai he belong on the brave but there is a reason chanc that lopez last year wa just as much a fluke as alomar in 90 or santiago in 87 on year at ani level at ani ag doesn t satisfi my standard of evid javier lopez 1971 1990 bur 428 101 10 1 9 5 0 1 179 33 236 245 327 1991 dur 389 84 8 1 9 14 7 2 175 29 216 243 311 1992 grn 445 135 22 2 14 22 7 2 271 71 303 336 456 1992 atl 16 6 2 0 0 0 0 0 306 3 375 375 500 maj 16 6 2 0 0 0 0 0 306 3 375 375 500 min 1262 320 40 4 32 41 14 5 213 133 254 277 368 tot 1278 326 42 4 32 41 14 5 214 136 255 278 369 maj 650 244 81 0 0 0 0 0 min 630 160 20 2 16 20 7 2 tot 630 161 21 2 16 20 7 2 on a similar note i don t understand why more peopl ar not support of neon deion grant i thought hi behavior with mccarver last year wa complet bush last year wa the first time he ever got 300 ab in on place so hi line ar hard to read but he ha a combin 720 op in minor leagu plai with hi speed is more valuabl than the op alon indic and at a still young ag 24 had a monster year with an 868 op he ha a total major and minor eqa of 249 abov major leagu averag and abov averag for cf which wa about 240 in the nl last year he ha shown at least the potenti of go into the 290s which would make him on of the 15 best hitter in the leagu he ha two full season befor reach hi prime season of 27 he should be consid as a legitim prospect and not as a simpl side show attract deion sander 1968 1988 fla 21 8 2 0 0 1 1 0 325 4 381 409 476 1988 int 20 3 1 0 0 1 1 1 086 0 150 190 200 1989 ea 123 35 1 2 2 9 15 4 257 19 285 333 374 1989 nyi 47 11 1 0 2 3 1 0 222 6 234 280 383 1989 int 263 70 11 4 6 18 15 6 246 37 266 313 407 1990 nyi 133 21 2 2 3 13 8 2 161 9 158 233 271 1990 int 85 26 7 1 1 14 8 1 312 18 306 404 447 1991 atl 110 20 2 1 4 12 10 3 201 12 182 262 327 1991 ric 129 30 5 2 4 7 11 3 230 17 233 272 395 1992 atl 306 92 10 12 11 22 24 9 295 60 301 348 520 maj 596 144 15 15 20 50 43 14 245 87 242 300 418 min 641 172 27 9 13 50 51 15 252 96 268 321 399 tot 1237 316 42 24 33 100 94 29 249 182 255 311 408 maj 600 145 15 15 20 50 43 14 min 603 162 25 8 12 47 48 14 tot 601 154 20 12 16 49 46 14 clai d
