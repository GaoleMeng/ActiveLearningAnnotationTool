it can be found at sumex aim in the info mac unix directori a few note on the compress format bin these ar macbinari file alwai us a binari file transfer protocol when transfer them never ascii or text most file on the net ar store as hqx instead onli rascal store most of it file in bin format most commun program such as zterm and mackermit ar capabl of translat macbinari file on the fly as thei download if thei know in advanc thei ll be download macbinari file imag thi format is normal us onli for system softwar so that on line user can download file that can easili be convert into exact copi of the instal floppi instead of us diskcopi to restor the imag to floppi you can us steve christensen s freewar util mountimag to treat the imag on your hard disk as actual floppi insert in a floppi drive mountimag ha a reput for be buggi so you should have some blank floppi and a copi of diskcopi handi just in case sea x x sea file don t merit a posit in the abov tabl becaus thei re self extract thei mai have been creat with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubl but all should be capabl of decompress themselv when doubl click for some unknown reason alysi ha chosen not to us thi industri standard design for self extract archiv creat with their paywar product superdisk and more disk space instead thei append either x or x to self extract archiv how can i get binhex stuffit etc 2 6 by far the easiest wai to get these program is to ask a human be to copi them onto a floppi for you if you re at a univers there s absolut no excus for not find someon to give you a copi and if you re anywher less remot than mcmurdo sound chanc ar veri good that someon at a comput center dealership or user group can provid you with a copi of stuffit onc you have stuffit ani version you don t need binhex if you re such a comput geek that the thought of actual ask a live breath human be instead of a comput termin for someth turn you into a quiver mass of protoplasm jelli you can probabl download a work copi of stuffit from a local bulletin board system if you have religi object to softwar gotten by ani mean other than anonym ftp then i suppos i ll mention that you can in fact ftp a work copi of stuffit though thi is by far the hardest wai to get it ftp to wuarchiv wustl edu and login type the word binari hit return type cd mirror rascal ic utexa edu compress and hit return then get stuffit_expand_1 0 1_sea_bin and hit return of cours it s alwai possibl that by the time you read thi stuffit expand will have been updat and the name chang so if thi fail look for someth similar if you ve ftp d straight onto your mac you should now have a self extract archiv which will produc a work copi of stuffit expand when doubl click if you ve ftp d to your mainfram or unix account first you still need to us a modem program to download it to your mac just make sure that the mac is receiv in macbinari mode and the mainfram is send in binari mode if you need more detail on the last step
