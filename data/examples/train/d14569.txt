perhap the oldest of the creed there is no mention of the danger of hell for non believ likewis there is no mention of the salvat of the believ soul and it destini in heaven after death there is onli the resurrect of the bodi and it doe not sai when or how you don t go far enough back if we believ in god and that he did creat the heaven and the earth and he did creat adam and ev and that thei walk in the garden and histori flow from there if we can agre with that then would you agre that the further back you go the closer you get to peopl who had a stronger memori of who god wa and what he said and command between adam and ev and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occur thi involv a gradual dim of conscious of the spiritu world thi is discern in the world outlook of differ peopl through histori the greek for exampl could sai better a beggar in the land of the live than a king in the land of the dead iliad i think the question of what happen to human be who di befor christ is an ever present on with christian i am not readi to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to etern damnat yet thei all di in their sin in the christian sens the same can be said of the whole of gentil human and also of the unrepent malefactor on the cross next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock hi deed of salvat at the veri moment of it fulfil in my studi of the ancient mysteri reliegion i have run across mani poem or ritual or what not with the interpret that those who ar of god will be with him via the promis seed but those who rebel will suffer etern life in die it wa a standard belief back then it is possibl to experi etern in a pass moment the relationship of etern to durat is not simpli on of indefinit extend condit of greenwich mean time it is possibl to imagin an etern of agoni or bliss or even mani of them in the spiritu world dure the time between earthli death and a new birth it wa also a standard belief among mani peopl that even the righteou were lost thi again is the result of the loss of the paradis conscious that fled from us after the fall with our ever increas involv with the sens world it would be interest to share in the result of your studi of ancient peopl s idea of life after death todai we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those peopl a thing or two but i think that as thi ag ha grown older that it is we who opper from a mist not those of the older ag mankind fell into mist and dark and at the turn point of time a new light enter into the world the light still grow and we ar develop the ey with which to see by it much new revel and growth in under stand li befor us our new vision and understand is still veri feebl but it contain someth new that will grow in time to embrac that which is old and much more as well at thi point i should acknowledg openli my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophi for mani insight that have led me to my view on thi subject i have said it befor i d love to post on thi but the vulcan hammer would fall the histori to purgatori can be shown from the druid in england to the greek who pilag it from the egyptian who ultim got it from the babylonian mysteri and ye the eastern religion also show mani similar i mean it black and white the write and the archeolog find plainli show it origin and the why and wherefor of thi doctin the wai you refer to it as doctrin put a modern intellectu color on it i think it wa much less abstract and much more real and spiritu concret a teach that struck much closer to home than our doctrin or teach todai can be receiv i am not so readi to attribut widespread notion in antiqu to simpl dispers from an origin sourc even if thei were pass on the question is to what extent did thei reflect real percept and experi the similar in the midst of great varieti of express of the differ peopl s idea of the time immedi after death testifi to the presenc of an underli realiti in ani case we studi geometri not by read old manuscript of euclid but by contempl the principl themselv on the other hand there is on notion firmli embed in christian that origin most definit in a pagan sourc the idea that the human be consist essenti of soul onli and that the soul is creat at birth wa conscious adopt from aristotl whose idea domin christian thought for fifteen hundr year and still doe todai he wa at onc the father of modern thought and at the same time live dure that darken time when the percept of our etern spiritu be had grown dim mayb at sometim in the futur inde i should also clarifi that i do not deni that etern irrevoc damnat is a real possibl but the narrow rang in which we conceiv of the decis moment i e after the end of a singl earthli life is not in my mind suffici to embrac the realiti and i think that is why the earli creed were couch in term that did not try to spell it out rex gerri 73237 2006 compuserv com
