i have 19 2 mb worth uuencod d gif imag contain chart outlin on of the mani altern space station design be consid in crystal citi mr mark holderman work down the hall from me and can be reach for comment at 713 483 1317 or via e mail at mholderm jscprof nasa gov mark propos thi design which he call geod rough on the outsid but a gem on the insid or the et strongback with integr hab modul and centrifug as you can see from file geodea gif it us a space shuttl extern tank et in place of much of the truss which is current part of space station freedom the white track on the outsid of the et is us by the station remont manipul system srm and by the reaction control system rc pod thi allow the rc pod to move along the track so that thrust can occur near the center of graviti cg of the station as the mass properti of the station chang dure assembl the inlin modul design allow the shuttl to dock more easili becaus it can approach closer to the station s cg and at a structur strong part of the station in the current ssf design dock forc ar limit to 400 pound which serious constrain the design of the dock system the et would have a hatch instal pre flight with littl addit launch mass we ve alwai had the abil to put an et into orbit contrari to some rumor which have circul here but we ve never had a reason to do it while we have had some good reason not to perform penalti control debri gener and eventu de orbit and impact footprint onc on orbit we would vent the residu h2 the et insul sofi either a erod on orbit from impact with atom oxygen or b stai where it is and we deploi a kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contamin the local space environ option b ha the advantag of provid further micrometeor protect the et is incred strong rememb it support the whole stack dure launch and could serv as the nucleu for a much more ambiti design as budget permit the white modul at the end of et contain a set of control moment gyro to be us for attitud control while the rc will be us for gyro desatur the modul also contain a de orbit system which can be us at the end of the station s life to perform a control de orbit so we don t kill ani more kangaroo like we did with skylab the centrifug which ha the same volum as a hab modul could be us for long term studi of the effect of lunar or martian graviti on human the centrifug will be us as a momentum storag devic for the whole attitud control system the centrifug is mount on on of the modul opposit the et and the solar panel thi design us most of the exist ssf design for electr data and commun system get leverag from the ssf work done to date mark propos thi design at joe shea s committe in crystal citi and he report that he wa warmli receiv howev the rumor i hear sai that a design base on a wingless space shuttl orbit seem more like pleas note that thi text is my interpret of mark s design you should see hi note in the gif file instead of post a 2 mb file to sci space i tri to post these for anon ftp in am arc nasa gov but it wa out of storag space i ll let you all know when i get that done ken jenk nasa jsc gm2 space shuttl program offic kjenk gothamc jsc nasa gov 713 483 4368 develop of the space station is as inevit as the rise of the sun wernher von braun
