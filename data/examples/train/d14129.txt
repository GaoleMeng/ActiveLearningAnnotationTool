post to the internet by wmiler nyx cs du edu 000062david42 041493003715 the lunar tele oper model on ltm1 by david h mitchel march 23 1993 introduct in order to increas public interest in space base and lunar oper a real miniatur lunar like environ is be construct on which to test tele oper model these model ar remot control by individu locat world wide us their person comput for edutain purpos not onli doe thi provid a test bed for simpl tele oper and tele presenc activ but it also provid for the share of inform on method of oper in space includ but not limit to layout of a lunar coloni tele oper machin for work and plai dissemin educ inform provid contest and award for creativ and achiev and provid a new wai for student worldwid to particip in twenti first centuri remot learn method becaus of the natur of the ltm1 project peopl of all ag interest and skill can contribut sceneri and mural model and structur interfac and electron softwar and graphic in oper ltm1 is an evolv playground and laboratori that can be us by children student and profession worldwid us a person comput at home or a termin at a particip institut a user is abl to tele oper real model at the ltm1 base for experiment or recreat purpos becaus a real facil exist ampl opportun is provid for media coverag of the construct of the lunar model it oper and new featur to be ad as suggest by the user themselv thi ha broad inher interest for a wide rang of group tele oper and virtual realiti research radio control model railroad and ham radio oper astronomi and space planetarium and scienc center art and theater bb and onlin network user softwar and game develop manufactur and retail of model rocket car and train children the child in all of us ltm1 overal design a room 14 feet by 8 feet contain the base lunar layout the wall ar us for mural of distant moon mountain star field and a view of the earth the floor is the simul lunar surfac a global call for contribut is herebi made for materi for the lunar surfac and for the design and creation of scale model of lunar coloni element sceneri and machin let the ltm1 initi design ha 3 tele oper machinelet 1 an ssto scale model which will be abl to lift off hover and land 2 a bulldozerlet which will be abl to move about in a quarri area and 3 a moon train which will travers most of the simul lunar surfac each machinelet ha a small tv camera util a ccd tv chip mount on it a person comput digit the imag includ reduc pictur content and do data compress to allow for minim imag to be sent to the oper for control purpos and also return control signal the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train sinc model train with tv camera built in ar almost off the shelf item and control electron for start and stop a train ar minim the user will receiv an imag onc everi 1 to 4 second depend on the speed of their data link to ltm1 next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspend from a servo motor oper wire frame mount on the ceil allow for the ssto to be control by the oper to take off hover over the entir lunar landscap and land final some tank model will be modifi to be ccd tv chip equip bulldozerlet the entir initi ltm1 will allow remot oper worldwid to receiv minim imag while actual oper model for land and takeoff travel and do work the entir system is base on commerci avail item and part that can be easili obtain except for the interfac electron which is well within the capabl of mani advanc ham radio oper and comput hardwar softwar develop by take a graphic orient commun program dmodem and ad a tele oper screen and control the necessari user interfac can be provid in under 80 man hour plan of action the diaspar virtual realiti network ha agre to sponsor thi project by provid a host comput network and internet access to that network diaspar is provid the 14 foot by 8 foot facil for actual construct of the lunar model diaspar ha in stock the electron tank that can be modifi and on ccd tv chip diaspar also agre to provid rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make avail the dmodem graphic commun packag and modifi it for control of the machin let an initi ground break with miniatur shovel will be perform for a live photo session and new confer on april 30 1993 the initi model will be put in place a time laps record will be start for histor purpos it is not expect that thi event will be complet seriou or solemn the lunar coloni will be declar open for addit build oper and experi a photograph will be present and the photograph taken will be convert to gif imag for distribut world wide to major onlin network and bb s a press releas will be issu call for contribut of idea time talent materi and scale model for the simul lunar coloni a contest for new design and techniqu for work on the moon will then be announc univers will be invit to particip the goal be to find instructor who wish to have class particip in variou aspect of the lunar coloni model field trip to ltm1 can be arrang and at that time the result of the class work will be ad to the model contributor will then be abl to tele oper ani contribut machin let onc thei return to their campu a monthli ltm1 newslett will be issu both electron onlin and via convent mean to the media ani major new tele oper equip addit will be mark with an invit to the televis new media have a larg real model space coloni will be a veri attract photo opportun for the televis commun especi sinc the action will be control by peopl all over the world scienc fiction writer will be invit to issu challeng to engin and human factor student at univers to build and oper the tele oper equip to perform lunar task us counter weight and pullei system 1 6 graviti mai be simul to some extent to try variou traction challeng the long term goal is creat world wide interest educ experiment and remot oper of a lunar coloni ltm1 ha the potenti of be a long term global edutain method for space activ and mai be the gener exampl of how to teach and explor in mani other subject area not limit to space edutain all of thi facilit the kind of spirit which can lead to a gener of peopl who ar readi for the leap to the star conclus edutain is the blend of educ and entertain anyon who ha ever enjoi see miniatur will probabl see the potenti impact of a global avail layout for recreat educ and experiment purpos by creat a tele oper model lunar coloni we not onli creat world wide public but also a method of try new idea that requir real not virtual skill and open a new method for put peopl s mind in space moonlight illumin the path of knowledg about space and lunar develop the follow peopl ar alreadi engag in variou part of thi work david42 rob47 dash hyson jzer0 vril wyatt the dark on tiggertoo the
