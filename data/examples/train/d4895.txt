my comment regard dec wa to indic that i might be open to other vendor that support opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is a graphic program librari and as such is a great portabl interfac for the develop of interact 3d graphic applic it is not howev an indic of perform as that will vari strongli from machin to machin and vendor to vendor sgi is commit to high perform interact graphic system and softwar tool so opengl mean that you can port easili from sgi to other platform there is no guarante that your perform would be compar what i am annoi about is the fact that we were led to believ that we would be abl to upgrad to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assist of a fork lift truck if your sale repres truli mislead you then you should have a valid grievanc against us which you should carri up to your local sgi sale manag team feel free to contact the local branch manag we understand that repeat sale come from satisfi custom so give it a shot i m also annoi about be sold sever person iris at a previou site on the understand that architectur would be around for a while rather than be flush as on of the previou post state the person iri wa introduc in 1988 and grew to includ the 4d 20 4d 25 4d 30 and 4d 35 as clock rate sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platform live for about 4 5 year thi wa true of the motorola base 3000 seri 85 89 the pi 88 93 the profession seri the earli 4d s 86 90 the power seri parallel system 88 93 individu cpu subsystem run at a particular clock rate usual live for about 2 year new graphic architectur at the high end gt vgx realityengin ar releas everi 18 month to 2 year these ar the fact of life if we look at these machin thei becom almost archaic after four year and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challeng which ha higher bu bandwidth faster cpu faster graphic and i o and larger disk capac if we don t we becom uncompetit from the user perspect you have to bui a machin that meet your current need and make econom sens todai you can t wait to bui but if you need a guarante upgrad path for the machin ask the sale rep for on in write if it s feasibl thei should be abl to do that some of our upgrad path have specif program associ with them such as the perform protect program for older r3000 base power seri multiprocess system which allow purchas of those system to obtain a guarante upgrad price for move to the new onyx or challeng r4400 base 64 bit multiprocessor system now i understand that sgi is respons to it investor and ha to keep show a posit quarterli bottom line odd that i found myself pressur on at least two occas to get the busi on the book just befor the end of the quarter but i m just a littl tire of get bone in the process if that s happen it s becaus of misunderstand or mi commun not becaus sgi is directli attempt to annoi our custom base mayb it s becaus my lab bui sgi in onesi and twosi so we aren t entitl to a peek under the cover as the big kid nasa for instanc ar thi lab and i suspect that a lot of other lab and organ doesn t have a load of monei to spend on comput everi year so we can t be out bui new system on a regular basi most sgi custom ar onesi twosei type but regardless we rare give a great deal of notic when we ar about to introduc a new system becaus again like a previou post state if we pre announc and the schedul slip we would mess up our potenti custom schedul when thei were count on the avail of the new system on a particular date and would also look awfulli bad to both our investor and the financi analyst who watch us most carefulli to see if we ar meet our commit the box that we bui now will have to last us pretti much through the entir grant period of five year and in some case beyond that mean that i need to bui the best piec of equip that i can when i have the monei not some product that wa built to paraphras on previou poster s word to fill a nich to compet with some other vendor i m go to be look at thi box for the next five year and everi time i look at it i m go to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my monei actual your monei sinc we re support almost entir by feder tax dollar five year is an awfulli long time in comput year new processor technolog ar arriv everi 1 2 year make a 5 year old comput at least 2 and probabl 3 gener behind the time the competit natur of the market is demand that rate of develop so if your time is realli 5 year between purchas you have to accept the limit viabil of whatev architectur you bui into from ani vendor there ar some realiti about the comput biz that we all have to live with but keep custom happi is the most import so don t give up we know it josh
