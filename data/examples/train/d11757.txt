ye i know it s nowher near christma time but i m gonna loos net access in a few dai mayb a week or 2 if i m lucki and want to post thi for interest peopl to save till xma note bell lab is a good place if you have a phd and a good boss i have neither subject xma light set with 2 level of bright anoth version of a variabl bright xma light set thi set start with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string diagram orgin 2 wai set 120v b b 120rtn_____________________ modifi set for 2 level bright string 1 120v _10k_______ 5w string 2 b ________________ 120v rtn__ ___ note no mod to wire to the right of thi point onli on blinker is us note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulb becaus of the second string of bulb in parallel with it that s why the us of the 10k 5w resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunt thru the second string while the blinker is glow and the second string is not glow when the blinker goe open thi resistor ha onli a slight effect on the bright of the string s1 slightli dimmer s2 slightli brighter or us a 3w 120v bulb in place of the 10k resistor if you can get on caution do not replac with a standard c9 bulb as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker c9 approx 7w what you ll see when it s work powerup string 1 will light at full bright and b will be lit bypass most of the current from the second string make them not light b will open place both string in seri make the string that wa out to glow at a low bright and the other string that wa on befor to glow at reduc bright be sure to wire and insul the splice resistor lead and cut wire in a safe manner
