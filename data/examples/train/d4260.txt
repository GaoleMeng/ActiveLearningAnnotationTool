david o hunt bluelobst cmu edu write i m pretti sure i ve seen biblic rule for when it s allow to rape prison what the code ar about that etc could some more knowledg soul than i pleas let me know some refer he ask a veri narrow question and i gave a veri narrow answer ye sorri i have got that wrong my apolog delet no david hunt s post didn t mention a god nor did my respons you were the first to bring up the idea of the bibl be given by god most jew don t believ thi in ani liter sens so no fun but i must have met the minor then and given by god refer to ani action wherebi a god god caus or better effect someth rob i am not intim with jewish theologi but i understand that you ar a messian jew correct me if i am wrong but it appear that the view of messian jew on metaphys is differ to that of the major of jew while jewish theologi overal is quit distinct from the christian god view i have heard that it is possibl for jew to attribut evil to their god an no no for christian the bibl is still seen as effect of the interact of some god with man delet no i thought we agre that though jew disagre there ar a set of core belief that thei do agre upon on of which is that the command ar access and written in the languag of the time and anoth of which is that there must be a legal system to updat them the context wa metaphys even when the process of adapt the command is not transcend the justif of the process lie in metaphys specualt i wonder how you break out of the shackl of have metaphys in your system delet could you explain thi with respect to the origin command be discuss that is the command that sai if you feel like rape a woman prison you should instead wait and marri her what about the wai thi command is given invalid it is is in a book that command to commit genocid among other reprehens deed the context is repuls and it is foul plai imo to invok some rel enlighten passag as an exampl for the content of the whole book big delet the point is that i see that there is a necessari connect between the theologi you us and the interpret of the bibl onli veri loos my interpret of the bibl is base on a long tradit of jewish scholar interpret the bibl theologi doesn t realli enter into it there ar jewish atheist who interpret the law of chariti essenti the same wai i do no not the interpret of some law but the interpret of the bibl as in the exampl that sodom and gomorrha mean argu with god the whole idea that it is metaphor and yet allow you to argu with a god whatev that mean that alon is a theo logic question is proof of a theologi us you pose anoth metaphys riddl no you do well you wrote thi fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolut power nor absolut knowledg and as it appear limit mean or will to commun with us some form of spiritu big friend do you admit that us god in thi context is somewhat unusu am i right in the assumpt that it cannot have creat the univers as well and that the passag in the bibl refer to that or it omnipot ar crap that s what i meant by the riddl it is an import question in the light of what for instanc the passag witrh sodom and gomorrha mean either there is some connect between the text the fact that it exist and your interpret of it or it is pure arbitrari further the question is why is ha on to carri the burden of biblic text when on could simpli write other book that convei the messag better you might answer that on can t becuas some peculiar biblic inform might be lost but that hold true of everi other book and the question remain why ha the bibl still a special place can t it be replac somehow is it ok to bargain the danger content of the bibl against some other messag that is includ as well delet do you see the danger in do so especi with the metaph us in the bibl i think the danger of do so is less than either the danger of have a frozen system of law or have no law sorri but there ar wors system doe not sai anyth about if on could not have a better system delet if we read two stori about the import of help the poor and in on god is a spirit and in the other god ha a bodi which is more import help the poor or resolv the contradict about the corpor natur of god if we read two stori in the bibl on that god command peopl to kill children for be idolat and anoth where god kill children directli what is more import to resolv the messag that children ar to be kill or if it ha to be done by god and the argument you have given is a fallaci while it mai not be import in the context you have given to find out if god is corpor or not it can be crucial in other question religi believ resolv contradict with that thei choos on of the possibl given in an arbitrari wai and have the advantag of be abl to attribut their decis to some god on cannot resolv question by the statement do what is good when what is good depend on the question benedikt
