dan sorenson vike iastat edu write in mcclaryc5snpq kb1 netcom com mcclari netcom com michael mcclari write just thought i d clear up a few of the murki area actual after surviv be driven out of nauvoo and later carthag the mormon did fortifi utah thei still arm themselv to defend the faith and stockpil food as well thei have been involv in quit a lot of illeg activ includ multipl and often underag wive for the leader a practic still in vogu with some splinter of their sect the parallel between koresh and joseph smith ar strike by thei you mean the leader of the ld church i grant you that when joseph smith wa still aliv plenti of accus were file most of which had littl bear with realiti as evidenc by variou verdict i have studi ld histori for 15 year now and i have yet to see prove that the ld leadership wa involv in quot illeg activ plural marriag ye but your charg of underag wive sound like it could have origin from a tabloid and discredit the high moral standard which character these leader and famili unlik as it appear those of david koresh joseph smith start the sect after he and hi brother hyram were murder in a nauvoo il jail cell church membership split over who to follow initi smith wa consid a prophet just like moham a rather interest parallel consid muslim consid christ to be a prophet the same as jew i m led to understand make no mistak thi wa no messiah we re talk about in smith the and neither did he claim he wa as the church reflect the moral aptitud of it leader and especi those of joseph smith i have noth but the highest respect for thi inspir man whose onli crime wa that he refus to deni that he had seen a vision mani have tri to explain the smith phenomenon awai but the bold presenc of an 8 5 million member strong church stand as a wit that joseph smith s testimoni had enough resili and power to carri on the messag thought at the time wa that the gift of propheci wa to be hand down father to son after joseph smith di hi son wa onli enter hi teen brigham young and a few other claim to have been bequeath the gift and leadership prior to hi death the council of twelv the church govern bodi wasn t of much help here and thi basic conflict is still a wedg between the sect brigham young took hi follow to salt lake the rest wait for smith jr to grow up enough to assum leadership the other claimant to the leadership were soon ignor like mike dukaki the rest were apost and excommun member of the church while the great major of the membership the twelv and the variou auxiliari organ chose to accept brigham young as the new prophet and leader of the church if you knew your ld scriptur and doctrin you would have known that brigham young wa the first in line to fill the prophet joseph smith s vacanc he wa the senior apostl in the quorum and variou comment made by joseph indic that it wa brigham who would lead the latter dai exodu to the west other right heir were either dead hyrum smith or excommun oliv cowderi and while persecut abound and intensifi joseph smith had alreadi given order to look for a new place an empti land beyond the boundari of the unit state at that time thi rekhabit principl pseudographia wa well understood and antip by the great major of ld faith and wa not question by them grant a coupl of do it yourself stai behind unwil to sacrific and to undertak the peril journei to the unknown but thi also wa necessari to separ the tare from the wheat the church benefit from thi purif process thei becam even more unifi and will to carri out their mission to the world both sect practic the 1 year food stockpil doctrin and thi be frontier and farm countri most carri or at least own weapon there is littl evid that thei were a militarist sect given that thei tend to move on rather than face larg scale opposit brigham young have suffer a great deal get to salt lake seem to have been quit justifi in make militari train a good thing rememb thi wa far beyond where even the us armi went and these peopl had nobodi to turn to save themselv just a littl context to put thi all in perspect btw sinc when is the church of jesu christ of latter dai saint on of the largest denomin in the countri a sect it didn t splinter from ani other religion as did sai the southern baptist or methodist so what did the mormon get it seem that j edgar hoover wa veri impress with the wai thei kept secret thei re pledg to defend secret with their live and aton for sin with blood mani actual do even to the point of suicid what a ballonei suicid is sin and against the law of god i am not comfort with thi alleg cosi with mammon i assur you that mani among us reject thi attitud categor period our onli true allegi is to our god and to the leader which he ha appoint to repres him in ani regard to read thi trash about suicid and aton for sin with blood is yet anoth insult misrepresent of what my church believ in and stand for the rld the reorgan ld ar friendli rival of the ld and delight in tell stori about them which gener quick retort from the ld member and everybodi ha a grand time at no time have i ever even heard thi hint at i m take it with a salt block make it a realli big salt mountain with a glacier on top so he hire virtual no on but mormon until the fbi wa almost exclus staf by member of the church of later dai saint though j edgar is final gone the fbi personnel especi the field agent ar still heavili mormon i have often wonder how thi might affect the fbi s treatment of religi organ a mormon would consid heret preposter even if thi were true reliabl data pleas i am convinc that those offic would perform to the highest code of honor and conduct that s why thei were select for in the first place rememb besid on of our articl of faith strongli state the principl of freedom of religion and that all peopl ar free to worship how where or what thei mai if it s true there would be littl affect ld and rld philosophi is that all other religion have strai from the true church as set down by jesu but that god will judg each on hi own merit in addit the rld also contend and the ld mai as well that ignor of the true wai tm is an excus you can onli be condemn if you had been tought the wai and reject it in short ld and rld suffer everybodi from lutheran to buddhist secur in the knowledg that though thei ar wrong thei will not be penal for ignor it is more like that hoover like them becaus of their rather strict upbring which forbad alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffe or tea and the like these peopl ar the salt of the earth and as such ar more easili made to follow order and have few vice to be us against them a good explan i can accept that you ar right that ld peopl ar sometim a littl too cosi with mammon s order the late presid kimbal for exampl wa an except with hi strong opposit of the select of the mx peac keeper missil maze in utah that s my somewhat educ guess anywai both sect have splinter group that don t mirror the mass but these ar small and rare and hardli worth note their common ancestri none of thi ha ani relev to gun though when a man s religion is us to deni him the right of self protect with
