michael siemon write homosexu christian have inde check out these vers some of them ar us against us onli through incred pervers interpret other simpli do not address the issu i can see that some of the abov vers do not clearli address the issu there ar exactli zero vers that clearli address the issu i agre that there ar no vers that have gone unchalleng by gai right activist but if there ar zero vers that clearli address the issu doesn t that mean that there ar also no vers that clearli support your case ar you sure you want to sai that there ar zero vers that clearli address the issu howev a coupl of them seem as though thei do not requir incred pervers interpret in order to be seen as condemn homosexu the kind of interpret i see as incred pervers is that appli to the stori of sodom as if it were a blanket equat of homosexu behavior and rape sinc christian cite the bibl in such a context should be presum to have at least read the stori it amount to slander a charg that homosexu rape to us that against us the stori in genesi 19 tell of the citizen of sodom demand an opportun to know the two men who were lot s guest the fact that the sodomit becam angri when lot offer them hi daughter could be seen as indic that thei were interest onli in homosexu intercours ye what thei want wa rape homosexu rape and everybodi agre that that is wrong some christian believ that the homosexu aspect of their desir wa just as sin as the rape aspect of their desir the passag doe not sai what it wa that so offend god whether it wa the homosexu or the intend rape or both but i believ that it is onli fair to consid all the possibl altern in the light of relat scriptur i do not believ that those who believ god wa offend by both the homosexu and the rape ar try to sai that homosexu is itself a form of rape you seem to take the view that the onli sin describ in gen 19 is in the fact that the sodomit want to commit rape and that it is unfair to stigmat their homosexu by associ it with the sin of rape i can see how you might reach such a conclus if you start from the conclus that there is noth wrong with homosexu but then again we re not suppos to start from our conclus becaus that s circular reason if god is in fact oppos to homosexu intercours in gener then the more probabl interpret is that he wa at least as offend by the sodomit blatant homosexu as he wa by their intent to commit rape later on i will document why i believ the old testament portrai god as on who despis ani homosexu intercours even if both partner ar consent adult do not be deceiv neither fornic nor idol nor adulter nor effemin nor homosexu nor thiev nor the covet nor drunkard nor revil nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor 6 9 11 the moder adequ discuss the circular of your us of _porneia_ in thi the moder found my propos to be circular in that he regard the church as the proper author for determin what kind of marriag would be legitim and thu the church s refus to recogn pervert marriag wa circular reason my question howev had noth to do with the church ordain new kind of marriag and so hi argument wa someth of a straw man in term of my origin question the precis definit translat of porneia isn t realli import unless you ar try to argu that the bibl doesn t realli condemn extramarit sex i m not sure the moder wa try to do that in ani case i think both you and the moder have miss the point here when jesu wa ask about divorc he repli have you not read that he who creat them from the begin made them male and femal and said for thi caus a man shall leav hi father and mother and shall cleav to hi wife and the two shall becom on flesh consequ thei ar no longer two but on flesh what therefor god ha join togeth let no man separ mt 19 4 6 i read here that the sexual union of a man male and hi wife femal is a divin ordain union in other word the institut of heterosexu marriag is someth ordain and establish by god not by men and not by the church but by god men ar not suppos to dissolv thi union in jesu word becaus it is not someth creat by men thi is not circular reason thi is just read god s word i read in the bibl that god ordain the union of male and femal i do not read of ani similar divin ordain union of two male or two femal grant there have been uninspir men who have ordain altern union isn t caligula report to have marri hi hors but the onli union that jesu refer to as what god ha join togeth is the heterosexu union of a man and hi wife pardon me for mention caligula i know that s probabl inflammatori and i should save it for the discuss on bestial in part 2 of thi post pleas hold off on pass judgement on me until you have read that section of my repli anywai my origin question wa not whether we should translat porneia in a wai that condemn onli a select few kind of extramarit sex my question wa given that heterosexu marriag is the onli union describ by the bibl as divin ordain and given a biblic prohibit against sex outsid of marriag is homosexu intercours sin of cours i see now that first we need to ask whether the bibl realli condemn sex outsid of marriag you seem to be try to argu that onli certain kind of extramarit sex and other sin ar realli wrong i think we can all agre with paul that there ar some kind of activ that could be name by fornic or theft or covet or revil or drunken which would well deserv condemn we mai or mai not agre to the bound of those categori howev and the veri fact that thei ar argu over suggest that not onli is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excel rhetorician had no interest in make them clear leav matter rather to our spirit led decis with all the uncomfort live with other read that ha domin christian discuss of all these area altern it mai be that the definit of such term as porneia and all the rest wa in paul s dai what we would call a faq i e the law as the tutor appoint by god to lead us to christ had just spent some sixteen centuri drum into the head of god s peopl the idea that thing like homosexu intercours were abomin that deserv punish by death perhap paul didn t go into detail on what porneia c were becaus after 1600 year he consid the question to have been dealt with alreadi perhap the reason god s apostl and prophet did not devot a great deal of time defin a distinct new testament sexual wa becaus he did not intend ani signific chang in the sexual he had alreadi establish by the law i ll discuss the law and homosexu in greater detail below but i just want to point out that the new testament s failur to develop a detail new standard of sexual is not necessarili evid that god doe not care about sexual conduct especi after 1600 year of put peopl to death for practic homosexu homosexu behavior is no differ i and the other gai christian i know ar adam in condemn rape heterosexu or homosexu and child molest heterosexu or homosexu and even the possibl harmless but obsess kind of sex heterosexu or homosexu that would stand condemn by paul in the veri continu of the chapter you cite mai i mildli suggest that what paul doe in hi letter that you want to us is perhap a good guid to hi mean i am free to do anyth you sai ye but not everyth is for my good no doubt i am free to do anyth but i for on will not let anyth make free with me 1 cor 6 12 which is a restat that we must have no other god befor god a command neither i nor ani other gai christian wish to break some peopl ar inde involv in obsess driven mode of sexual behavior it is just as wrong though slightli less incendiari so it s a secondari argument from the phobic conting to equat homosexu with such behavior as to equat it with the rape of god s messeng and how do you defin an obsess driven mode of sexual behavior how do you determin the differ between obsess sexual behavior and normal sex drive is the desir to have sin sex an obsess driven mode of behavior i think you see that thi is circular reason why is it defin as sin becaus it is obsess what make it obsess the fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it s sin or is it obsess becaus it is a desir for that which societi condemn onc again that s circular why is it defin as obsess becaus the person want it even though societi condemn it why doe societi condemn it becaus it is obsess you seem to be try to limit the bibl s condemn of porneia to onli pervert sex act but i don t think you can realli defin pervert without fall into exactli the same circular you accus me of what then is paul condemn when he declar that fornic shall not enter the kindgom of heaven i won t deal with the exegesi of leviticu except veri tangenti fundament you ar exhibit the same circular here as in your assumpt that you know what _porneia_ mean i think you misunderstood me i wa not try to make an argument on some technic definit of porneia i wa rais the issu of the sin of extramarit sex and the lack of ani scriptur evid of a homosexu counterpart to the divin ordain union of heterosexu coupl there ar plenti of law prohibit sexual behavior to be found in leviticu most of which christian ignor complet thei never even bother to examin them thei just assum that thei know which on ar moral and which on ar ritual well i have new for you ani anthropolog cours should sensit you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categori in an aw lot of societi we have them too but buri pretti deep and i cannot see ani ground for distinguish these bit of leviticu from the ritual law which no christian i know feel appli to us i m dead seriou here when peopl start go on as thei do in thi matter about how repuls and unnatur our act ar and what do thei know about it huh it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrari cultur inculc as the american prejudic against eat insect pleas rememb what you just said here for when we discuss bestial in part 2 on what basi other than assum your conclus can you sai that the law against male male intercours in leviticu is not a part of the ritual law i am glad you ask would you agre that if god condemn homosexu intercours even among those who ar not under the law of mose then thi would show that god s condemn of homosexu act goe beyond the ritual law if i can show you from scriptur that god punish the homosexu behavior of peopl who were not under the law of mose would you agre that god s definit of homosexu intercours as an abomin is not limit to just the ritual law and those who ar under the law i ve been have a privat email discuss with a 7th dai adventist on the subject of the sabbath and my main point against a christian sabbath keep requir ha been that nowher in scriptur doe god command gentil to rest on the sabbath nor doe he ever condemn gentil for fail to rest on the sabbath thi illustr the differ between univers requir such as thou shalt not kill and requir that ar mere part of the temporari jew onli law of mose such as the sabbath the point you ar try to make is that you think the classif of homosexu intercours as an abomin is just a part of the temporari jew onli law of mose i on the other hand believ that it wa label by god as an abomin for gentil as well as jew and that he punish those guilti of thi behavior by death or exil here s why back in genesi 15 god promis to give abraham all the land that wa then in the possess of the amorit kinda hard on the amorit don t you think but in vers 16 we have a clue that thi might not be as unjust as it sound it seem god is go to postpon thi takeov for quit a while becaus the iniqu of the amorit is not yet complet rememb thi is all long befor there wa a ritual law what then wa the iniqu the amorit wa commit that when complet would justifi hi be cast out of hi own land and or kill go back and look at lev 18 again vers 1 23 list a varieti of sin includ child sacrific incest homosexu and bestial begin in vers 24 god start sai do not defil yourselv by ani of these thing for _by_all_these_ _thing_ the nation which i am cast out befor you _have_ _becom_defil_ for the land ha becom defil therefor i have visit it punish upon it so the land ha spew out it inhabit for whoever doe ani of these abomin those person who do so shall be cut off from among their peopl notic that god sai the gentil nation who ar not under the ritual law of mose ar about to be punish becaus thei have defil themselv and their land by commit abomin that includ incest bestial and homosexu flip ahead two chapter to lev 20 and you will find these same abomin list and thi time god decre the death penalti on anyon involv in ani of these thing includ specif a man ly with anoth man as on li with a woman lv 20 13 their bloodguilti wa upon them mean that in god s ey thei deserv to die for have done such thing accord to lev 18 26 29 even the alien non jew who sojourn among you wa to refrain from these practic on penalti of be cut off by god from among their peopl under the circumst i believ it would be veri difficult to support the claim that in the old testament god object onli to the intend rape and not the homosexu in sodom sinc god took the troubl to specif list sex between two consent men as on of the reason for wipe out the canaanit nation not homosexu rape mind you but plain voluntari gai sex i d sai god wa not neutral on the subject of homosexu behavior even by those who had noth to do with the mosaic coven for those christian who do think that some part of leviticu can be law for christian while other ar not even to be thought about it is incumb on you in everi case handl on it own merit to determin why you pick on and ignor anoth accord to ii tim 3 16 all scriptur is inspir by god and is profit for teach reproof correct and train in righteous thu i believ that even though we gentil christian ar not under the law we can learn from studi it if a certain action is defin as a sin becaus it is a violat of the law then it is a sin onli for those who ar under the law for exampl in the case of sabbath keep where god reveal that certain action ar abomin even for those who ar not under the law then i conclud that god s object to the practic is not base on whether or not a person is under the law but on the sin of the act itself in the case of homosexu homosexu intercours is defin by god as a defil abomin for gentil as well as jew i e for those who ar not under the law as well as for those who ar thu i am not at all try to sai that gentil christian have ani oblig to keep ani part of the law i am simpli sai that god refer to homosexu as a sin even for those who ar not oblig to keep the law if thi is so then i do not think we can appeal to our exempt from the law as valid ground for legitim a practic god ha declar a bloodguilti abomin that defil both jew and gentil continu in part 2 mark
