correl with irrat belief in absolut irrat belief in absolut is strongli correl with fanat delet theism is correl with fanatic i have neither said that all fanat is caus by theism nor that all theism lead to fanat the point is theism increas the chanc of becom a fanat on could of cours argu that would be fanat tend toward theism for exampl but i just have to loook at the time in histori when theism wa the domin ideolog to invalid that conclus that that is the basic mechan behind it imo the influenc of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalid your assumpt that theism is the factor to be consid bogu i just said that theism is not the onli factor for fanat the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consid your argument as us as the follow belief is strongli correl with fanatic therefor belief is a factor in fanatic true and utterli useless note thi is ani belief not belief in god tire to sai the least i have back it up read the first statement i have read it conspicu by it absenc is ani evid or point the latter is the fallaci of the wrong analog sai someon believ someth is hardli an inform about the person at all sai someon is a theist hold much more inform further the correl between theist and fanat is higher than that between belief at all and fanat becaus of the special featur of theistic belief truth by blatant assert evid gullibl blind obedi to author lack of sceptic and so on ar all more reliabl indic and the realli danger peopl the sourc of fanatic ar often none of these thing thei ar cynic manipul of the gullibl who know precis what thei ar do that s a claim you have to support pleas note that especi in the field of theism the leader believ what thei sai if you believ that you re incred naiv you frank o dwyer ar live in a dream world i wonder if there is ani base of discuss left after such a statement as a matter of fact i think you ar ignor of human natur even when on start with someth on doe not believ on get easili fool into actual believ what on sai to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement the onu of proof is on you sunshin what make you think that theist leader believ what thei sai especi when thei sai on thing and do anoth or sai on thing close follow by it opposit the practic is not restrict to theism but it s there for anyon to see it s almost an epidem in thi countri just for instanc if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the ey of a needl why is the cathol church such a wealthi land owner why ar there church to the squar inch in my countri now some brand of theism and more precis some theist do tend to fanatic i grant you to tar all theist with thi brush is bigotri not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm up for censorship and restrict of religi freedom ever read anim farm that s a straw man and as usual in discuss with you on ha to repeat it read what i have written abov not everi theism lead to fanat and not all fanat is caus by theism the point is there is a correl and it come from innat featur of theism no some of it come from featur which some theism ha in common with some fanatic your last statement simpli isn t impli by what you sai befor becaus you re try to sneak in innat featur of all theism the word you re grope for is some bogu again not all theism as is is fanat howev the rest alreadi give backup for the statement about the correl about fanat and theism and further the specialti of other theistic belief allow them to switch to fanat easili it take just a nifti improv in the theologi truth by blatant assert gullibl by the wai is on of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibl instead of theism sinc it seem a whole lot more relev to the case you have as oppos to the case you ar try to make becaus there is more about theism that the attract to gullibl peopl caus the correl and the whole discuss start that wai by the statement that theism is meaningfulli correl to fanat which you challeng inde i did as i recal i ask for evid what is the correl of which you speak and to sai that i am go to forbid religion is anoth of your straw men interest that you have noth better to offer i said it read like a warm up to that that s becaus it s an irrat and bogu tirad and ha no other us than creat a nice them us split in the mind of excit peopl such as ar to be found on either side of church wall blah blah blah i am quit well awar that give everyon their right protect me better from fanat than the other wai round of cours other peopl ar alwai fanat never oneself your wish to slur all theist seem pretti fanat to me it is quit nice to see that you ar actual impli a connect between that argument and the rise of fanat so far it is just anoth of your assert so you can do it 2 defin irrat belief e g is it ration to believ that reason is alwai us irrat belief is belief that is not base upon reason the latter ha been discuss for a long time with charlei wingat on point is that the belief violat reason often and anoth that a process that doe not lend itself to ration analysi doe not contain reliabl inform well there is a glare paradox here an argument that reason is us base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrat which is it that s bogu self refer is not circular and sinc the evalu of us is possibl within ration system it is allow o k it s oval it s still beg the question howev and though that certainli is allow it s not ration and you claim to be ration and all anoth of your assert no proof no evid just claim hei i learn it from you did i do good at the risk of repeat myself and hear we had that befor we didn t hear a _refut_ befor so we re back deal with it you can t us reason to demonstr that reason is us someon who think reason is crap won t bui it you see that is unusu weak even for you the latter impli that my proof depend on their opinion somehow who doe not accept that there ar triangl won t accept pythagora wow that s an incred insight i don t have to prove them wrong in their opinion it is possibl to show that their system leav out us inform respect claim unreli or even absurd statement to be inform total circular and total useless their wish to believ make them believ thing ar judg by their appeal and not by their inform it make you feel good when you believ that mai be good for them but it contain zillion of possibl pitfal from belief despit contrari evid to the bogu proof thei attempt truth by blatant assert i ve seen as mani bogu proof of the non exist of god as i have of their exist ration system by the wai doe not mean that everi data ha to come from logic analysi the point is that the evalu of the data doe not contradict logic it easili follow that such a system doe not allow to evalu if it ration in itself ye it is possibl to evalu that it is ration in a system that is not ration by the fallaci of that system but sinc the valid of the axiom is agre upon that ha as littl impact as the possibl of a demon ala descart thi just doesn t pars sorri so far it just a matter of consist i us ratiion argument to show that my system is consist or that their isn t the evalu of the nor thi predict doe not need ration it doe not contradict howev your argument is as silli as prove mathemat statement need mathemat and mathemat ar therfor circular anybodi els think godel wa silli stream of conscious type what is that suppos to mean the first part of the second statement contain no inform becaus you don t sai what the belief ar if the belief ar strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in gener true the second part of your sentenc is patent fals counterexampl an axiomat datum doe not lend itself to ration analysi but is assum to contain reliabl inform regardless of what process is us to obtain it i ve been speak of religi system with contradictori definit of god here an axiomat datum lend itself to ration analysi what you sai here is a an often refut fallaci have a look at the discuss of the axiom of choic and further on can evalu axiom in larger system out of which thei ar usual deriv i exist is deriv if you want it that wai further on can test the consist and so on of a set of axiom what is it you ar try to sai that at some point peopl alwai wind up sai thi datum is reliabl for no particular reason at all exampl i am not dream nope there is evid for it the trick is that the choic of an axiomat basi of a system is difficult becaus the possibl ar interwoven on therefor choos that with the least assumpt or with assumpt that ar necessari to get inform out of the system anywai i d like to see thi alleg evid on doe not need to defin axiom in order to defin an evalu method for us the foundat is laid by how on feel at all that s not how on feel about it i see you have no irrat belief but then fanat never do do thei compar the evid theist have for their claim to the strength of their demand make the whole thing not onli irrat but antir i can t agre with thi until you ar specif which theism to sai that all theism is necessarili antir requir a proof which i suspect you do not have us the traditon definit of god person supernatur entiti with object effect on thi world usual connect to moral and or the wai the world work imo ani belief about such god is necessarili irrat that doe not mean that peopl who hold them ar in principl oppos to the exercis of intellig some atheist ar also scientist for exampl thei don t us theism when do scienc or it wouldn t be scienc pleas note that subject data lend themselv to a scientif treatment as well thei just prohibit formul them as object statement ergo noth is object fair enough the affin to fanat is easili seen it ha to be true becaus i believ it is noth more than a work hypothesi howev the belief sai thei ar more than a work hypothesi i don t understand thi can you formalis your argument person a believ system b becuas it sound so nice that doe not make b true it is at best a work hypothesi howev the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesi test or evalu evid for or against it therefor dismiss becaus b alreadi believ sai it is wrong a wast of time not possibl depend on the further content of b amalekit idolat protest ar to be kill thi can have interest effect peculiar definit of interest but sure now show that a belief in god entail the further content of which you speak why aren t my cathol neighbour out kill the protest for exampl mayb thei don t believ in it mayb it s the conjunct of b assert b and jail kill dissent that is import and the belief in god is entir irrelev it certainli seem so to me but then i have no ax to grind here the exampl with your neighbour is a fallaci that your neighbour don t sai littl about other and there were time when exactli that happen nope it s not a fallaci it just doesn t go to the correl you wish to see and tell me when it is not irrelev why ar such statement about amalekit and idolat in the holi book pleas note that on could edit them out when thei ar not relev anymor becaus god don t err what doe that sai about that messag excus me the holi book and how come we had theist sai genocid order by god ar ok a god is the easiest wai to excus anyth and therefor highli attract to fanat not to mention the effect interpret by these fanat can have on the rest of the believ happen again and again and again a god is neither the easiest wai to excus anyth nor the onli wai frank o dwyer i m not hatch that odwyer sse ie from hen by evelyn conlon
