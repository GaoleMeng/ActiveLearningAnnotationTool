will be hold a hear on the question rais in thi letter there mai also be a follow on hear dedic to the clipper chip but that s not definit glenn thank for post that i wa surpris to notic howev that on question i might have expect to be ask wa not ar all form of strong encrypt other than the clipper to be made illeg speak of which is anyon awar of whether that question ha been ask of ani knowledg or offici spokesperson for the govern i have not yet seen it mention in ani of a dozen place it might have been report but i could have easili miss it pleas let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legal of other strong cryptosystem so far ani refer i have seen have been weasel word more plan in the futur etc but noth that could be taken as a no strong crypto will not be outlaw i have heard not verifi that the crime bill befor congress ha languag that either requir escrow of kei or that will regard all system unapprov for public us like strong cryptosystem not trivial broken by the govt or without escrow kei which on cannot readili chang read us be onli permit by folk with special connect or govern agenc as either terrorist tool or drug dealer tool not outlaw specif but by ad civil forfeitur power and clever word effect outlaw for all intent and purpos now for some idl specul for those who don t care hit n now crypto be effect outlaw could be done without specif outlaw ani class of crypto system for exampl a crowbar hammer screwdriv and such can be regard as burglar tool pretti much at the whim of the author base primarili on the individu possess them in the car etc not be in a trade that make routin us of these tool in a like manner on who ha no legitim need gov t definit for strong crypto softwar or system and is caught us them might find themselv in possess of terrorist tool in other word if on is not work for a corpor with extrem sensit commerci data that warrant in the fed s opinion strong secur or a govern agenc and secur onli work relat data not person data on will most like be nail on thi if discoverd a person desir for privaci most certainli will not be regard as a legitim need why do you want such strong secur especi from legitim law enforc an individu with legitim endeavor would not be so concern govern is not in the busi of reveal your person secret to the public so you must be try to conceal or plan to conceal some unlaw or crimin activ do you have someth to hide hmmmm i expect that initi there will be some peopl select either at random or who happen to have been troublemak for the purpos of make an exampl for those who think the fed ar not seriou about thi mega s on ask about a right to privaci will probabl get a respons that there is no constitut right for privaci spell out as such an argument us in the abort debat you do not have a right to have secur that legitim law enforc cannot break as suggest in the clipper press releas thi in a nutshel is what i find so extrem frighten not onli for crypto system as in thi case but for the precid it will set lai the groundwork for futur eros of privaci escrow of both safe deposit box kei master kei or combin for privat own safe and so on why not i cannot think of a better wai to make an end run around those inconveni part of the us constitut a law cannot be easili declar unconstitut if it there is no specif law it would simpli be a minor extens of the rico statut or wod polici a simpl polici decis just like so mani of the gun regul ar mainli batf polici decis the convers of the fed agent would go someth like we ar gonna seiz your home your comput your car your bank account you don t have to undress and give us yer cloth unless you have a floppi in yer pocket becaus thei ar all connect with your acquisit transport and us of terrorist tool and or drug dealer tool part of the wod or against terror ya unnerstand no decent american subject would be against these nobl caus note we ar not accus you of ani wrong do we ar onli sai your home comput car bank asset ar connect with wrong do somehow thei hous transport and fund these terrorist tool onli a civil matter heh heh we had thi tip grin therefor the constitut protect on individu right do not appli we ar arrest the taint properti not you evil grin if you wish to deposit a bond hire some attornei and go to court to prove the innoc of thi properti that thei ar not terrorist tool and again to prove thei ar not also drug dealer tool go ahead we have no problem with that cours with your bank asset seiz no car comput or home probabl no job too and your less than limitless resourc you might run into some minor practic difficulti grin that is what ha me go so damn ballist it is exactli how the logic goe when someon give a tip that your home ha been us to store drug note no trace of drug need to be found on the properti onli some bozo who will sai yup i store stuff in that dude s hous probabl to get out of a 10 year sentenc for deal much more cost effect to let him walk to bust anoth dai and hit the jackpot with your asset ob disclaim of cours ok note that i am not a lawyer and can onli base these specul on what i have read heard been told regard past civil forfeitur case and how thei ar us to augment the budget of assort agenc or to get cooper of folk who just want to be left alon or who do not wish to be put in a riski situat especi in area where thei ar deni either meaning polic protect and the mean to be abl to even pretend to defend themselv as is quit common back east like nj ma nyc wa dc or out west in ca these peopl have the choic of cower under the govern boot or cower under threat of piss off drug deal gang banger helpless in either case all behind some dude who drop a dime on you for hi gain or behind the fed want to make an exampl civil forfeitur be the hook point is ar these specul wai out of line or ar thei all too typic and if so doe the extens to crypto and just about anyth that the fed regard as inconveni seem reason and if not why not what
