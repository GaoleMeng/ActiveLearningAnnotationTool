circumcis done by christ have been buri with him in baptism and rais with him through your faith in the power of god who rais him from the dead in baptism we ar rais to a new life in christ roman 6 4 through a person faith in the power of god our parent s faith cannot do thi do infant have faith let s look at what the bibl ha to sai about it i don t think the issu of whether infant have faith is relev or not certainli thei can as the exampl of john in utero prove i find the translat of col 2 abov odd in term of the circumcis of christ which the kjv and rsv put in term of christ s cricumcis which we in union with him particip in put off the bodi of sin of the flesh also perhap cor 2 12 is divid the act of burial with him in baptism which can be independ of faith from the experi of rise with christ by faith who sai both ar by faith thi interpret ha the advantag of explain those who ar faithlessli baptiz for whom their baptisim is not benefit but serv to put them into the kingdom nonetheless like the israelit all of them children includ who were baptiz in the cloud and in the sea it wa of no advantag becaus thei did not add to their baptism faith and obedi baptism doe not impart faith nor is it done strictli speak on the basi of the faith of the parent but becaus of the covcen promis of god it impart grace the grace of the kingdom which can be a punish in disguis if there is later apostaci roman 10 16 17 but not all the israelit accept the good new for isaiah sai lord who ha believ our messag consequ faith come from hear the messag and the messag is heard through the word of christ so then we receiv god s gift of faith to us as we hear the messag of the gospel faith is a possibl respons to hear god s word preach kid ar not yet spiritu intellectu or emotion matur enough to respond to god s word henc thei cannot have faith and therefor cannot be rais in baptism to a new life do you teach a child to prai the lord s prayer do you expect them to not steal thei can have faith appropri to their condit and in the new coven we shall no longer sai know the lord for thei shall all know him from the least unto the greatest heb 8 11 if you read all of ezekiel 18 you will see that god doesn t hold us guilti for anyon els s sin so we can have no origin guilt from adam but also accord to ezekiel 18 god will not hold innoc anyon on the basi of anyon els innocens thu jesu could not be our feder head ani more than adam if that s what ezekiel is talk about shall you make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well ezekiel 18 31 32 rid yourselv of all the offens you have committ and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o hous of israel for i take no pleasur in the death of anyon declar the sovereign lord repent and live the wai to pleas god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit kid cannot do thi act 2 38 39 sai that when we repent and ar baptiz we will then receiv a new spirit the holi spirit then we shall live ezekiel 36 25 26 indic that thi new heart will be given by god in the context of the sprinkl of water in baptism it is the action of god pute them into hi new order and not a question of person faith as such roman 5 12 therefor just as sin enter the world through on man and death through sin and in thi wai death came to all men becaus all sin sin and death enter the world when the first man sin death came to each man becaus each man sin note that it s good to read through all of roman 5 12 21 some of the vers ar easier to misunderstand than other but if we read them in context we will see that thei ar all sai basic the same thing let s look at on such but the death that came to all becaus of sin is not just their person death but the dead state originb sin we ar in a coven of death becaus adam our feder head gave over hi dominion to the devil and death psalm 51 5 sure i wa sin at birth sin from the time my mother conceiv me thi whole psalm is a wonder exampl of how we should humbl ourselv befor god in repent for sin david himself wa a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after commit adultri with bathsheba and murder her husband all that david is sai here is that he can t rememb a time when he wasn t sin he is humbl himself befor god by confess hi sin hi sai that he wa sin at birth is a hyperbol the bibl be inspir by god isn t limit to a liter interpet but also us figur of speech as did jesu john 16 25 for anoth exampl of hyperbol see luke 14 26 while thi psalm is figur in it s languag it is not hyperbol and the on doe not necessarili impli the other there is not other hyperbol languag in thi psalm what v 5 is like refer to is what is symbol by the ot cleanli law which make intercours and childbrith both act which cau uncleann and seper from god the whole psalm is in the languag of ot ritual hyssop cleans burnt offer etc david s sin with bathsheba includ thi element as he did not ritual cleans himself when he should have but what wa symbol by the ot ritual wa the truth that sin wa pass generation that s why the organ of gener had to be cut that s why brith wa unclean unclean wa death and all babi were born dead and need to be wash to new of life which we have in baptism todai paul duggan
