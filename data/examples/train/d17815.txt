do doctor willingli testifi against each other in malpractic case when thei do go to court obvious absolut essenti to prove malpractic it us to be imposs to get doctor here to do that a possibl advantag of the us system you won t hear about from the ama our doctor monopoli is exactli the same as in the u s if not more power now that thei can dictat insur payment rate but i don t know an answer to thi on anecdot my friend who ar md s includ my main bud from high school talk about how hard it is to turn state s wit against someon els no direct experi there though also in some circumst you mai have to sue the insur plan peopl here after all sue health insur compani all the time i heard about a gui in alberta who came down with some rare ey diseas that he had to take repeat trip to seattl to get treat it cost him and hi famili someth like $6000 and the provinc year later still ha onli reimburs them for $500 or so well what american privat insur plan cover travel expens sinc our public insur plan ar publicli account on can rais a stink in the media to try and extort benefit beyond which on is entitl hei not alberta s fault that he live there if he live in cheyenn wy hi privat insur would ve told him to go to hell for the travel expens and that s that an hmo would have just kept quiet and let him go blind well yeah tell us about the nation defens medic centr outsid ottawa it serv the same purpos as the bethesda naval hospit sinc not all hospit can provid everyth mayb thei have some stuff that other don t ottawa s popul is onli a quarter million if you includ the surround counti my point wa that someth that should necessarili remain unpolitic ha becom veri politic to the detriment of it mission i don t think that thi ha been shown with the dmc the problem is in a system where hospit annual budget ar approv by the govern how do you keep polit consider out of medic decis i bet that if you re an mp or mpp or good friend with on you re put on ani hospit s urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless you re someon who get bump off the list for some bigshot peopl of influenc will get their wai in ani system american or european it s the golden rule he who ha the gold make the rule but to what extent doe it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessari in the first place it s worth think about it s regular practic in a hospit to figur out who need to get at what facil don t american have to arrang in advanc for oper too i think that there ar two standard be appli here and that canada can t give beverli hill style treatment to everybodi it s not a big brother list it s more like call around town for a tabl for dinner yeah but privat nonprofit foundat have to make monei somehow especi in the hospit busi ye and the tori in ottawa ar try to make them do that rather than hope for a bigger grant from the fed and their provinc the next time around whether it s us mop a coupl of week longer or even sell servic to american rememb our system is cash base and sinc our health care infrastructur is overbuilt except in specialti that requir larger popul to gener busi why not the altern is close unus ward busi whether canadian would be thrill at the prospect of their own health servic cater toward american who would be will to pai more than thei do is anoth issu entir it must be note that thei said thei were do it partli becaus their grant from the provinc were get smaller if those grant ar so insubstanti why the need to attract foreign to make up the differ you answer the question yourself privat nonprofit foundat have to make monei somehow and i think that it s about time that thei act like the privat hospit that thei ar person i m fed up with canadian socialist try to tell everyon that their health care is free when we ar actual bui insur that s on at you bob rae the gdp figur ar combin public and privat expenditur for total outlai and ar compil us the same method by the oecd that yield the 13 14% figur for the u s but don t the us figur includ dentistri and optometri where the canadian on until recent anywai didn t sinc we have alwai been evalu in an oecd style i don t see how rememb oecd count both privat and public fund and in canada like franc and germani 30% of health care spend is privat fund i e not the basic health insur monei so what happen if the health care system financi collaps how thei ar collect premium and i m an advoc of have copay like the french do in their system well if you spend more than you take in you go bankrupt it s that simpl if the provinci insur system find themselv pai out more than thei get in revenu thei won t be abl to pai for everybodi s primari care ye the infrastructur will be there but will everybodi be abl to continu us it at the same rate minor copay can flush out abus rememb that our system is onli an insur polici but our cost aren t rise fast enough to ensur adequ copay deduct last year quebec s user fee propos came out with the number of $5 as the necessari hike that could be done through a copay rather than give the qma a rais and it s not contract time yet as far as i can tell from upi clarinet even the new reform parti a breakoff of traditionalist from the conserv with a mildli libertarian faction hold our public health insur as an untouch but that just a few peopl have to be remind that it s not free the averag canadian european is more fiscal naiv than their american counterpart on issu like these but no mention of copay anywher to be seen but cut public spend all over the place and bring back the death penalti with littl hast if elect i know that for pete s sake i live right on the border i know the canadian system isn t social medicin unlik britain s nh sorri it s just that i even run into peopl from buffalo and from michigan who don t know the point is that mean that if the monei run low in the plan you re out of luck unless you can afford it yourself yeah but there d be a lot of lead time and a health care crisi that would preclud it if provinci govern as bad as some of them ar heck we have the ndp clean up a spend mess made by the conserv in saskatchewan embarass can be so irrespons there is still realloc health insur is so import that it s about the onli thing that can inspir open rebellion and violent insurrect outsid of the hockei rink right now attempt to get the system and it user to learn good habit ar be treat like cod liver oil would the privat insur take up the slack thei d be under no oblig to of cours thei could eventu make monei again but if what you sai is true thei d be loath to do so and out of practic in handl such basic servic too some of the compani provid extra insur ar subsidiari of american compani and their parent provid full insur down here regardless all firm up north can easili turn on cabl tv to see how well the american firm ar do by be involv in basic coverag the privat firm ar make too much monei after have gotten rid of basic coverag thei run around pat them selv on the back for their own cooper in provid extra for those peopl who deserv it yeah but eventu it s go to creat a kind of two tier effect that will be notic after a while like in britain most american ar fear of a singl tier system serious there ar few area that have suffici popul for a two more tier system like what the french have a health polici prof d g shea ha cite studi in the nejm that indic have a popul of 500 000 is necessari for adequ competit and in canada there ar onli four citi west of the great lake with that popul or larger anywai the number show that cost have held steadier than those in the u s and bar ani futur chernobyl like crisi sudden transient in spend ar unlik in fact the health alloc is on of the most well behav sector of spend up north so ani talk of bankruptci is talk radio fodder far awai from the border if the provinc hit fiscal rough spot and have to cut back the thing privat insur have to offer will seem less and less like luxuri and the gap will be more and more notic thi won t be overnight and someth like thi would forc canada to have a system more like the french on but that s not a bad thing and the chang will be minim i e add copay and frustrat the socialist chant hei it s free gld je me souvien gari l dare gld columbia edu
