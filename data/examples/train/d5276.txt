i am happi to announc the first public releas of the bit program an interact full color imag viewer and editor base on sgi gl besid typic touchup task such as crop rotat smooth etc bit offer some uniqu featur not avail in similar program such as text and vector support and the separ of text and imag the follow is the relev section from the man page pre releas of mai 1993 bit 1l name bit bitmap imag touchup for sgi workstat descript bit is an interact full color imag viewer and editor base on silicon graphic gl as a full color program bit handl imag of both 24bit and color index in a natur and effici manner as an imag viewer bit allow list of imag to be displai in their origin type 24bit or color index in ani order and in ani of the mani built in style of displai you can walk up and down the list us mous and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom featur larg imag can be view in full without be limit by the window or screen size as an imag editor bit perform a larg number of imag edit and process task accur and effici it keep inform loss at ani stage of the edit process at an absolut minimum by perform subpixel sampl automat while conserv the input imag type whenev possibl to avoid unnecessari promot and or quantiz of input imag you can also cut a piec of an imag and past it into anoth in addit arbitrarili color and size text and simpl geometr figur can be render on top of an imag for annot with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separ to take advantag of the higher printer resolut e g postscript bit can also be us as a graphic user interfac to mani exist imag process program by defin extern bind which in essenc turn command line orient program into bit subfunct and can be access by a press of a button and best of all the process imag will be read back and displai immedi convolut us exter nalli defin matric of arbitrari order can be perform dynam give great flexibl in process an imag featur bit perform all of it imag manipul interact with a continu progress report and onc the process is complet the process imag will be displai current featur includ o rotat an imag by an arbitrari angl with the option of anti alias and fill the rotat out region with an arbitrari color o scale an imag by arbitrari factor in x and or y direct with the option of subpixel sampl o render text of arbitrari color size or orient on top of an imag with the option of render directli into the raster or save the text and raster separ such as into a postscript file to take advantag of a higher printer resolut besid normal text string mani predefin special symbol can be input conveni as in tex 1 e g $ alpha$ small$ beta$ produc greek alphabet alpha follow by a slightli smaller greek alphabet beta o present graphic the histogram of an imag o perform arbitrari 1 to 1 pixel transform the transform function can be specifi interact and can be of arbitrari form further the transform can be appli to rgb channel separ or simultan and to the entir imag or a portion of it mani difficult task such as threshold can be accomplish rather easili by 1 to 1 transform in combin with the avai labil of graphic histogram of the imag o place simpl geometr figur sgf e g arrow circl trian gle etc of arbitrari color size and orient into an imag at arbitrari locat address either in absolut pixel or in some user defin coordin system unit with the option of render directli into the raster or save the sgf and raster separ e g postscript file all sgf can be scale in x and y direct independ or simultan thi is how to get an ellips from a circl o perform edg detect in combin with imag histogram and 1 to 1 transform veri accur result can be obtain o perform histogram equal o perform convolut with extern defin squar matric of arbitrari order o crop a rectangular portion of an imag o cut and past across imag o magnifi ani portion of an imag by ani amount o displai a list of imag in sequenc with a user specifi paus interv between imag slideshow o measur rgb intens of a pixel at ani locat or all pixel along an arbitrari line with the result present as rgb intens or as an intens vs distanc plot o perform imag type convers o convert imag format o smooth an imag special convolut o filter an imag by extern program and read the filter imag back and displai it o modifi an individu pixel s rgb valu o perform fft on the entir imag or a portion of it and displai the result power spectra o sprai and brush paint in full color unavail in thi pre releas support format o iri rgb nativ to sgi iri o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm portabl ani map includ ppm pgm and pbm o xbm x window bitmap o tiff o postscript write onli hardwar requir ani sgi workstat that support rgbmode includ indigo where to get it anonym ftp to mont svec uh edu pub bit bitxxx tar z where xxx is the version number current version is 0 73 read src 01readm for instal instruct after unpack acknowledg jpeg support is base on the independ jpeg group s librari version 4 form librari develop by mark overmar is us for gui both jpeg and form librari ar includ in thi releas bit is the program you will ever need to view and annot imag the built in edit featur will satisfi most of your edit need in addit the extern filter and dynam kernel will util ani program you alreadi have so try it and you will like it as alwai
