sever more letter and phone call in which we discuss term for hi do such an analysi but in which we never discuss either of our opinion regard the second amend gun control or ani other polit subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysi into which i have insert my question for the sake of clariti copperud the word a well regul militia be necessari to the secur of a free state contrari to the interpret cite in your letter of juli 26 1991 constitut a present participl rather than a claus it is us as an adject modifi militia which is follow by the main claus of the sentenc subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arm is assert as an essenti for maintain a militia in repli to your number question schulman 1 can the sentenc be interpret to grant the right to keep and bear arm sole to a well regul militia copperud 1 the sentenc doe not restrict the right to keep and bear arm nor doe it state or impli possess of the right elsewher or by other than the peopl it simpli make a posit statement with respect to a right of the peopl schulman 2 is the right of the peopl to keep and bear arm grant by the word of the second amend or doe the second amend assum a preexist right of the peopl to keep and bear arm and mere state that such right shall not be infring copperud 2 the right is not grant by the amend it exist is assum the thrust of the sentenc is that the right shall be preserv inviol for the sake of ensur a militia schulman 3 is the right of the peopl to keep and bear arm condit upon whether or not a well regul militia is in fact necessari to the secur of a free state and if that condit is not exist is the statement the right of the peopl to keep and bear arm shall not be infring null and void copperud 3 no such condit is express or impli the right to keep and bear arm is not said by the amend to depend on the exist of a militia no condit is state or impli as to the relat of the right to keep and bear arm and to the necess of a well regul militia as a requisit to the secur of a free state the right to keep and bear arm is deem uncondit by the entir sentenc schulman 4 doe the claus a well regul militia be necessari to the secur of a free state grant a right to the govern to place condit on the right of the peopl to keep and bear arm or is such right deem uncondit by the mean of the entir sentenc copperud 4 the right is assum to exist and to be uncondit as previous state it is invok here specif for the sake of the militia schulman 5 which of the follow doe the phrase well regul militia mean well equip well organ well drill well educ or subject to regul of a superior author copperud 5 the phrase mean subject to regul of a superior author thi accord with the desir of the writer for civilian control over the militari schulman 6 if at all possibl i would ask you to take account the chang mean of word or usag sinc that sentenc wa written 200 year ago but not take into account histor interpret of the intent of the author unless those issu can be clearli separ copperud to the best of my knowledg there ha been no chang in the mean of word or in usag that would affect the mean of the amend if it were written todai it might be put sinc a well regul militia is necessari tot he secur of a free state the right of the peopl to keep and bear arm shall not be abridg schulman as a scientif control on thi analysi i would also appreci it if you could compar your analysi of the text of the second amend to the follow sentenc a well school elector be necessari to the secur of a free state the right of the peopl to keep and read book shall not be infring my question for the usag analysi of thi sentenc would be 1 is the grammat structur and usag of thi sentenc and the wai the word modifi each other ident to the second amend s sentenc and 2 could thi sentenc be interpret to restrict the right of the peopl to keep and read book _onli_ to a well educ elector for exampl regist voter with a high school diploma copperud 1 your scientif control sentenc precis parallel the amend in grammat structur 2 there is noth in your sentenc that either indic or impli the possibl of a restrict interpret professor copperud had onli on
