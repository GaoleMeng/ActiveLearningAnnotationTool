is the tripl encryt us is it just to gain an effect increas in keyspac to defeat a potenti keysearch if so why us 80 bit kei not know anyth about the skipjack algorithm it s not realli possibl to guess whether thi make it harder or easier to guess s1 s2 why ar n1 n2 and n3 form as thei ar it would be facin to see the skipjack algorithm to look for wai of attack it that requir three ciphertext block form in that odd wai where do the 34 bit constant valu that ar concaten with the serial number to form n1 n2 n3 come from ar thei chang from chip to chip or session to session even if thei re publish in the ny time if skipjack is resist to known plaintext attack when us tripl encrypt then there s no break in secur but why allow that kind of weird format if those three 34 bit valu ar truli random bit then mayb it s us to ensur that a known plaintext attack on skipjack if it exist can t be easili us to deriv s1 and s2 for a whole product run of these chip i can t answer all our question in detail but i can take a stab at them the form the oper that comput r1 r2 and r3 is of cours the famou tripl encrypt suggest for us with de it s much stronger than a singl encrypt and ha an effect kei length of 160 bit for reason that were discuss when de wa first standard a simpl doubl encrypt would not have the same strength tripl encrypt ha been us by ibm sinc more or less the begin to encrypt other kei it s recommend for anyth of veri high valu and i think we can agre that the r_i and s_i fit that descript why n_1 n_2 and n_3 well you need differ plaintext valu i have no idea if thei ll be disclos or not at a guess thei re construct so that thei differ in as mani bit posit as possibl a goo cryptosystem will scrambl thing a lot with even a 1 bit chang but the valu of n in a seri will have fairli similar bit pattern and there might conceiv be a weak so the n_i valu ar and i m guess chosen to increas the ham distanc in ani event i m quit convinc that on cannot go back to the s_i from the u_i let alon u observ if the nsa ha u thei don t need to find s_i but even if thei do thei can t get u_1 and u_2 in theori thei should never even see those valu even with a warrant the real question i think is why us thi scheme at all as oppos to a hardwar random number gener my answer is that thi is much more verifi look suppos that nsa nist the aclu the eff and the nra combin to build a realli good random number gener and that it pass everi test you could think of when you come back next week to program some more chip doe it still work that well have ani compon chang in valu have the compon been chang out from under you doe it still work well the in the presenc of a focus microwav beam that tend to bia it toward select 1 bit ye you can run detail statist test on it again but that s hard consid on the other hand a softwar solut you bring your own floppi with you you can run cryptograph checksum etc it s a lot easier to verifi that the softwar is unchang in other word ye i can think of wai to cheat softwar too i think that thei re a lot harder there ar three issu with clipper the first is whether or not the architectur of the whole scheme is capabl of work my answer with on signific except is ye i realli do think that nsa and nist have design thi scheme about as well as can be assum that their real object ar as state to permit wiretap under certain carefulli control circumst with a minimum risk of abus the except is that u exist outsid of the chip on a program diskett that s serious wrong u_1 and u_2 should be load onto the chip separ to those who disagre and i don t claim my answer is obviou though i found my own reason suffici persuas that i wa forc to rewrit the conclus section of my technic analysi paper i had origin blast the scheme i issu thi invit assum that you were charg with implement such a system with complet regard for civil right and due process what would you do differ in answer thi question pleas accept nsa s fundament assumpt that both strong cryptographi against outsid and the abil to wiretap some domest user is necessari if you feel it necessari to challeng those assumpt do it in the context of the last issu i present below right here i m discuss just the technic aspect and no i don t by ani mean claim that just becaus someth can be done it should be the second issu is whether or not thi whole architectur is actual go to be us just becaus clipper chip ar made thi wai doesn t mean that that s the onli wai thei ll be made mayb the nsa will substitut it own chip between the program facil and the ship dock and thei ll gener bogu warrant request so that the escrow agent don t wonder why thei ve never call sorri gui all them terrorist and drug dealer and pedophil seem to have bought tripl de phone instead who d a thunk it i have no answer to thi question and at the moment i don t see a wai of answer it those concern ar part of my reason in my answer to the final question below the third and most seriou issu is whether or not clipper is a good idea even if carri out strictli accord to the letter of the law i think that the answer is no but it s not a no brainer i m a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reason that i explain at great length on the net in the elder dai and that i don t have the energi to repeat now but that mean that i m will to accept that some law ar necessari so long as thei respect the essenti right of individu the govern alreadi ha the abil and in our system the right to issu search warrant and while that power ha certainli been abus it s also been us quit properli and fairli in other case is kei escrow suffici differ i think so but again it s not an easi question for me it is easi for libertarian to answer of cours sinc clipper is complet alien to much of the rest of their oft admir philosophi and it s also easi for those who give their unreserv trust to govern a group i m much more distant from steve bellovin
