introduct disclaim although we ve done a fair bit of wire we ar not electrician and we cannot be respons for what you do if you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it contact someon qualifi a licens electrician or your local electr inspector electr is no joke mistak can result in shock fire or electrocut furthermor our discuss is base on the u s nation electr code nec and the canadian electr code cec to the best of our abil we have confirm everi detail with the electr code but we don t quot section simpli to keep thi thing readabl if you think we re wrong we invit you to correct us but pleas quot refer the nec and the cec do not in and of themselv have the forc of law mani municip adopt it en toto other howev do not check your with your local build depart and provinci hydro inspect offic in canada to find out what appli in your area also your local electr util mai also have special requir for electr servic instal bear in mind too that we sai here appli primarili to ordinari singl famili resid multi famili dwell mobil home commerci establish etc ar sometim govern by differ rule also note that contrari to popular belief in the u s and in some part of canada canada is not a wholli own subsidiari of the u s consequ the nec doe not appli in canada lot of thing ar the same includ voltag line frequenc and the law of physic but there ar a number of crucial differ in the regul where we can we ve note them flag the relev passag with nec or cec rememb that the cec and nec ar minim standard it is often smart to go beyond their minim requir subject what is the nec where can i get a copi the nec is a model electr code devis and publish by the nation fire protect associ an insur industri group it s revis everi three year the 1993 version ha been releas you can bui a copi at a decent bookstor or by call them directli at 800 344 3555 the code exist in sever version there s the full text which is fairli incomprehens there s an abridg edit which ha onli the section like to appli to most hous and there s the nec handbook which contain the author commentari on the code as well as the full text that s the recommend version unfortun there s no handbook for the abridg edit and the full handbook is expens us$65 plu ship and handl subject what is the cec where can i get a copi the canadian standard associ is an organ made up of variou govern agenc power util insur compani electr manufactur and other organ the csa publish csa standard c22 1 which is updat everi two or three year each provinc adopt with some amend thi standard and publish a provinc specif code book sinc each provinc publish it own slightli modifi standard it would be somewhat confus to obtain the csa standard itself in thi faq cec realli mean the appropri provinci standard in particular thi faq is deriv from the ontario hydro electr safeti code 20th edit 1990 which is in turn base on csa c22 1 1990 16th edit while differ exist between the provinc an attempt ha been made to avoid specif to ontario detail the appropri provinci code can be obtain from electr inspect offic of your provinci power author in ontario it s ontario hydro the ontario hydro book isn t overli fat it s about c$25 and includ mail updat i hear that these standard ar somewhat easier to read than the equival nec public don t bother ask in quebec dii wire is ban throughout the provinc subject can i do my own wire extra pointer in most place homeown ar allow to do their own wire in some thei re not check with your local electr inspector most place won t permit you to do wire on other s home for monei without a licens nor ar you permit to do wire in commerci build multipl dwell eg duplex ar usual consid semi commerci or commerci howev mani jurisdict will permit you to work on semi commerci wire if you re supervis by a licens electrician if you can find on will to supervis if you do your own wire an import point do it neat and well what you realli want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do after all it s your own home and it s you or your famili that might get kill if you make a mistak an electrician ha time pressur ha the skill and know the trick of the trade to do a fast safe job in thi faq we ve conscious given a few recommend that ar in excess of code becaus we feel that it s reason and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that you re an amateur you have to earn hi trust the best wai of do thi is to spend your time do as neat a job as possibl don t cut corner exce specif otherwis the inspector mai get extrem picki and fault you on the slightest transgress don t try to hide anyth from the inspector us the proper tool ie don t us a bread knife to strip wire or twist wire with your finger the inspector won t like it and the result won t be that safe and it take longer and you re more like to stick a hunk of 12ga wire through your hand that wai don t handl hous wire when it s veri cold eg below 10c or 16f thermoplast hous wire particularli older type becom veri brittl subject what do i need in the wai of tool first there s the obviou a hammer a drill a few screwdriv both straight and phillip head if you re lucki enough to live in canada or find a sourc of csa approv devic you need robertson squar recess screwdriv 1 and 2 instead of phillip for drill a few hole a 3 4 or 1 spade bit and 1 4 or 3 8 electr drill will do if you re do a lot or ar work with elderli lumber we recommend a 1 2 drill right angl drill ar wonder can be rent and 3 4 or 1 screw point auger drill bit these bit pull you through so thei re much faster and less fatigu even in 90 year old hardwood timber screw driver bit ar us for drill expeci if you instal your electr box us screw drywal screw work well for strip wire us a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinari wire cutter don t bui the $3 k mart combo stripper crimper and bottl open type you should expect to pai $15 to $20 for a good plier type pair it will have size strip hole and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easi to strip wire with it on model ha a small hole in the blade for form exact wire loop for screw termin there ar fancier type autostrip cut but thei gener aren t necessari and pro usual don t us them a pair of diagon side cutter plier ar us for clip end in constrict place don t us these for strip wire you will need linesman plier for twist wire for wire nut you should have a pair of needl nose plier for fiddl insid box and close loop but it s better to form wire loop with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accur if you re us non metal cabl get a cabl stripper for remov the sheath or do what some pro do thei nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of plier and simpli rip the sheath back us the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off you shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point becaus it s too easi to slash the insul on the conductor appar stanlei util knive fit with linoleum cutter hook blade can be us to strip sheath but there is still the possibl that you ll goug the conductor for ani substanti amount of work with armor cabl it s well worth your while to invest in a rotari cabl splitter us$ 18 hack saw ar tricki to us without cut into the wire or the insul three prong outlet tester ar a quick check for properli wire outlet about $6 multimet tell you more but ar a lot more expens and probabl not worth it for most peopl a simpl voltag sensor which can detect potenti through an insul wire not suppli ani devic is extrem help thei cost about us$ 10 at radio shack you should have a voltag detector to check that the wire ar dead befor do work on them neon bulb version ar cheap $2 3 and work well if you get more seriou a audibl alarm type is good for trace circuit without a helper though i ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breaker until the scream stop for run wire through exist wall you need fish tape often two tape ar need though sometim a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffic fish tape can be rent electr tape lot of it serious a good and compet wire job will need veri littl tape the tape is us for wrap dici insul in repair work anoth us is to wrap around the bodi of outlet and switch to cover the termin screw i don t do thi but drywal contractor prefer it to prevent explos when the drywal knife collid with a live outlet that ha no cover plate subject what is ul list the ul stand for underwrit laboratori it us to be an insur industri organ but now it is independ and non profit it test electr compon and equip for potenti hazard when someth is ul list that mean that the ul ha test the devic and it meet their requir for safeti ie fire or shock hazard it doesn t necessarili mean that the devic actual doe what it s suppos to just that it probabl won t kill you the ul doe not have power of law in the u s you ar permit to bui and instal non ul list devic howev insur polici sometim have claus in them that will limit their liabil in case of a claim made in respons to the failur of a non ul list devic furthermor in mani situat the nec will requir that a wire compon us for a specif purpos is ul list for that purpos indirectli thi mean that certain part of your wire must be ul list befor an inspector will approv it and or occup permit issu subject what is csa approv everi electr devic or compon must be certifi by the canadian standard associ befor it can be sold in canada implicit in thi is that all wire must be done with csa approv materi thei perform test similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approv is requir by law again like the ul if a fire wa caus by non csa approv equip your insur compani mai not have to pai the claim in canada there is a branch organ of the ul call ulc ul of canada ulc doe not have power of law and seem to be more a liason group between the csa and insur compani subject ar there ani cheaper easier to read book on wire usa the follow three book were suggest by our reader residenti wire by jeff markel craftsman book carlsbad ca for $18 25 isbn 0 934041 19 9 practic electr wire residenti farm and industri base on the nation electr code ansi nfpa 70 herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co wire simplifi h p richter and w c schwan park publish co try to make sure that the book is base on the latest nec revis which is current 1990 canada p s knight author and publish a book call electr code simplifi there appear to be a version publish specif to each provinc and is veri ti into the appropri provinci code it focus on residenti wire and is indispens for canadian dii er it is better to get thi book than the cec unless you do a lot of wire or answer question on the net it is updat each time the provinci code ar thi book is avail at all dii and hardwar store for less than c$10 subject inspect how and what why should i get my wire inspect most jurisdict requir that you obtain a permit and inspect of ani wire that is done amongst other more mundan bureaucrat reason like insur compani not like to have to pai claim a permit and inspect provid some assur that you your famili your neighbor or subsequ owner of your home don t get kill or lose their home on night due to a sloppi wire job most jurisdict have the power to order you to vacat your home or order you to tear out ani wire done without a permit california for instanc is particularli nasti about thi if fire start in your home and un inspect wire is at fault insur compani will often refus to pai the damag claim in gener the process goe like thi you appli to your local inspect offic or build depart for a permit you should have a sketch or detail draw of what you plan on do thi is a good time to ask question on ani thing you re not sure of if you re do major work thei mai impos special condit on you requir load calcul and ask other question at thi point thei will tell you which inspect you will need if you re instal a main panel you will need to have the panel and servic connect inspect befor your power util will provid a connect thi is sometim done by the local power author rather than the usual inspector after instal the box and wire but befor the insul wall go up you will need a rough in inspect after the wall ar up and the wire is complet you will need a final inspect subject my hous doesn t meet some of these rule and regul do i have to upgrad in gener there is no requir to upgrad older dwell though there ar some except ie smoke detector in some case howev ani new work must be done accord to the latest electr code also if you do major work you mai be requir to upgrad certain exist portion or all of your system check with your local electr inspector subject a word on voltag 110 115 117 120 125 220 240 on thing where thing might get a bit confus is the differ number peopl bandi about for the voltag of a circuit on person might talk about 110v anoth 117v or anoth 120v these ar all in fact exactli the same thing in north america the util compani ar requir to suppli a split phase 240 volt 5% feed to your hous thi work out as two 120v 5% leg addition sinc there ar resist voltag drop in the hous wire it s not unreason to find 120v ha drop to 110v or 240v ha drop to 220v by the time the power reach a wall outlet especi at the end of an extens cord or long circuit run for a number of reason some histor some simpl person ornery differ peopl choos call them by slightli differ number thi faq ha chosen to be consist with call them 110v and 220v except when actual sai what the measur voltag will be confus a bit just ignor it on thing that might make thi a littl more understand is that the namepl on equip ofen show the lower ie 110v instead of 120v valu what thi impli is that the devic is design to oper properli when the voltag drop that low 208v is not the same as 240v 208v is the voltag between phase of a 3 phase y circuit that is 120v from neutral to ani hot 480v is the voltag between phase of a 3 phase y circuit that s 277v from hot to neutral in keep with 110v versu 120v strang motor intend to run on 480v three phase ar often label as 440v subject what doe an electr servic look like there ar logic four wire involv with suppli the main panel with power three of them will come from the util pole and a fourth bare wire come from elsewher the bare wire is connect to on or more long metal bar pound into the ground or to a wire buri in the foundat or sometim to the water suppli pipe ha to be metal continu to where the main water pipe enter the hous watch out for galvan action conduct break often between copper and iron pipe thi is the ground conductor it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlet is connect to ground thi wire normal carri no current on of the other wire will be white or black with white or yellow stripe or sometim simpli black it is the neutral wire it is connect to the centr tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribut transform suppli the power it is connect to the ground conductor in onli on place often insid the panel the neutral and ground should not be connect anywher els otherwis weird and or danger thing mai happen furthermor there should onli be on ground system in a home some code requir more than on ground electrod these will be connect togeth or connect to the neutral at a common point still on ground system ad addit ground electrod connect to other portion of the hous wire is unsaf and contrari to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral ar usual brought as separ conductor from the main panel and ar not connect togeth in the subpanel ie still onli on neutral ground connect howev in some situat certain categori of separ build you actual do have to provid a second ground electrod consult your inspector the other two wire will usual be black and ar the hot wire thei ar attach to the distribut transform as well the two black wire ar 180 degre out of phase with each other thi mean if you connect someth to both hot wire the voltag will be 220 volt if you connect someth to the white and either of the two black you will get 110v some panel seem to onli have three wire come into them thi is either becaus the neutral and ground ar connect togeth at a differ point eg the meter or pole and on wire is do dual duti as both neutral and ground or in some rare occas the servic ha onli on hot wire 110v onli servic subject what is a circuit insid the panel connect ar made to the incom wire these connect ar then us to suppli power to select portion of the home there ar three differ combin 1 on hot on neutral and ground 110v circuit 2 two hot no neutral and ground 220v circuit 3 two hot neutral and ground 220v circuit neutral and or two 110v circuit with a common neutral 1 is us for most circuit suppli receptacl and light within your hous 3 is usual us for suppli power to major applianc such as stove and dryer thei often have need for both 220v and 110v or for bring sever circuit from the panel box to a distribut point 2 is usual for special 220v motor circuit electr heater or air condition note in the us the nec frequent permit a circuit similar to 2 be us for stove and dryer name that there ar two hot wire and a wire that doe dual duti as neutral and ground and is connect to the frame as well as provid the neutral for 110v purpos three prong plug instead of four onli for stove dryer connect to the main panel when connect to most sub panel 4 prong plug and receptacl ar requir in our not so humbl opinion thi is crazi but the nfpa claim that thi practic wa re evalu for the 1992 nec and found to be safe check your local code or inquir as to local practic there ar restrict on when thi is permiss 1 is usual wire with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for ground 2 and 3 have on hot wire colour red the other black a bare wire for ground and in 3 a white wire for neutral you will sometim see 2 wire with just a black white and ground wire sinc the white is hot in thi case both the nec and cec requir that the white wire be perman mark at the end to indic that it is a live wire usual done with paint nail polish or sometim electr tape each circuit is attach to the main wire come into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there ar in a few local circuit that look like 1 2 or 3 except that thei have two bare ground wire some place requir thi for hot tub and the like on ground is frame ground the other attach to the motor thi mai or mai not be an altern to gfci protect subject ground versu ground versu neutral accord to the terminolog in the cec and nec the ground conductor is for the safeti ground i e the green or bare wire the word neutral is reserv for the white when you have a circuit with more than on hot wire sinc the white wire is connect to neutral and the ground conductor insid the panel the proper term is ground conductor howev the potenti confus between ground conductor and ground conductor can lead to potenti lethal mistak you should never us the bare wire as a ground conductor or white wire as the ground conductor even though thei ar connect togeth in the panel but not in subpanel subpanel ar fed neutral and ground separ from the main panel usual in the trade and in common usag the word neutral is us for ground conductor thi faq us neutral simpli to avoid potenti confus we recommend that you us neutral too thu the white wire is alwai except in some light switch applic neutral not ground subject what doe a fuse or breaker do what ar the differ fuse and circuit breaker ar design to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exce safe level for exampl if your toaster short out a fuse or breaker should trip protect the wire in the wall from melt as such fuse and breaker ar primarili intend to protect the wire ul or csa approv supposedli indic that the equip itself won t caus a fire fuse contain a narrow strip of metal which is design to melt safe when the current exce the rate valu therebi interrupt the power to the circuit fuse trip rel fast which can sometim be a problem with motor which have larg startup current surg for motor circuit you can us a time delai fuse on brand is fusetron which will avoid trip on momentari overload a fusetron look like a spring load fuse a fuse can onli trip onc then it must be replac breaker ar fairli complic mechan devic thei usual consist of on spring load contact which is latch into posit against anoth contact when the current flow through the devic exce the rate valu a bimetal strip heat up and bend by bend it trip the latch and the spring pull the contact apart circuit breaker behav similarli to fusetron that is thei tend to take longer to trip at moder overload than ordinari fuse with high overload thei trip quickli breaker can be reset a finit number of time each time thei trip or ar thrown when the circuit is in us some arc take place which damag the contact thu breaker should not be us in place of switch unless thei ar special list for the purpos neither fuse nor breaker limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can caus hundr or sometim even thousand of amper to flow for a short period of time which can often caus sever damag subject breaker can t i us fuse statist show that fuse panel have a significantli higher risk of caus a fire than breaker panel thi is usual due to the fuse be loos screw in or the contact corrod and heat up over time or the wrong size fuse be instal or the proverbi replac the fuse with a penni trick sinc breaker ar more perman instal and have better connect mechan the risk of fire is consider less fuse ar prone to explod under extrem high overload when a fuse explod the metal vapor cloud becom a conduct path result from complet meltdown of the electr panel melt servic wire through fire in the electr distribut transform and have your hous burn down breaker don t do thi mani jurisdict particularli in canada no longer permit fuse panel in new instal the nec doe permit new fuse panel in some rare circumst requir the special insert to kei the fusehold to specif size fuse some devic notabl certain larg air condition requir fuse protect in addit to the breaker at the panel the fuse is there to protect the motor wind from overload check the label on the unit thi is usual onli on larg perman instal motor the instal instruct will tell you if you need on subject what size wire should i us for a 20 amp circuit us 12 gaug wire for a 15 amp circuit you can us 14 gaug wire in most local for a long run though you should us the next larger size wire to avoid voltag drop 12 gaug is onli slightli more expens than 14 gaug though it s stiffer and harder to work with here s a quick tabl for normal situat go up a size for more than 100 foot run when the cabl is in conduit or gang with other wire in a place where thei can t dissip heat easili gaug
