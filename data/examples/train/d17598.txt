don t know what you as a white male did i do know what white male as a class have done thei ve invent the light bulb the automobil the airplan print with movabl type photographi comput the electr guitar anasthesia rocket power space flight the comput electr the telephon tv motion pictur penecillin sp telescop nylon and the x rai machin two glare error here first white male don t do anyth as a class individu white male invent those thing which mean noth to white male as a whole second you neglect to mention charl manson hitler mccarthi jack the ripper ted bundi and a whole slew of individu who have done horribl evil thing if white male can take the credit for our fellow white male boon we must also take the blame for our fellow blight i claim we deserv neither credit nor blame for these thing we ar told by u s congresswoman barbara jordan that we ar biolog incap of compass she s full of shit we ar told by susan brownmil that we re all rapist and that s all we ar she s full of shit we re told by catherin comin that a fals rape charg is actual good for us she s full of shit we ar told by the feminist lawyer that we ar not to be trust with children thei re full of shit we ar told by newsweek magazin that we ar poor sport if we complain newsweek is full of shit the point ladi and gent michael is not entir correct in hi theori that becaus member of our race and gender made great advanc the race and gender as a whole deserv more respect than thei receiv white male do deserv to be treat better than thei ar be treat but not for that reason and the male basher he quot ar repugn hate monger no better than the chauvinist thei despis so no on s right as usual white male need to wake up and realiz that thei re be unfair ye but everyon els need to wake up and realiz that be unfair right back is disgust racist and sexist why can t we learn to treat everyon fairli without gener what stupid gene make thi so difficult i d like to bui the world a clue the word that is miss in thi whole discours is not the b word or the h word or even the n or w word it is the l word loser that s right when we boil all the crap out of thi argument it is all about win and lose and noth els let me explain rememb the eighti no excus nobodi who can handl a mail buffer can claim thei ar too young to rememb ronald reagan yet the eighti were about how america learn to win onc again then wouldn t you know we won so well that there wa noth left to win no cold war to endur no nuclear holocaust no more world to conquer we forgot about outer space long ago the kind of overwhelm no hold bar success that kill alexand the great ye there were a few littl problem along the wai stock market meltdown here an s l bailout there a few revolt and crazi middl eastern dictat to contend with but as tacitu would tell ya the god augustu never had it so good in the meantim there is guilt for win mayb a fear that on doesn t deserv on s bounti or success so there is a kinder and gentler type of politician these dai bill clinton affirm action and lot of discours about peopl who don t get it for those of us in the win busi thi kind of talk is mildli irrit but there is still no suggest of lose but what do we find now to put it mildi the stereotyp of our white male non winner is woodi hay in the rose bowl punch out photojournalist when those california fruit and nut steal anoth on with a hail mari pass in the fourth quarter the whole idea behind three yard and a cloud of dust is to wear your oppon down until he collaps in the final period but woodi just us hi fist uzzi seem to be the weapon of choic these dai who is d fen anywai the answer is as plain as the horn rim on your face the gui is michael dougla pose as a loser thi is known as controversi cast but that baggi short sleev white shirt sure doe look natur on mike doesn t it gordon gekko will never look the same though woodi alwai dress that wai did we realli expect gekko to take it easi and enjoi that kind of wardrob without put up a fuss what we ar start to lose sight of is that bash d fen is the same game as bash that poor african american slug that clint eastwood us to blow awai all the time as that arch wasp male gender georg c scott declaim american tradition love to win thei love a winner and will not toler a loser and so on the polit implic ar simpl if as mani socialist and democrat do you consid societi a finit pie to a apport in some equit wai then you have to worri about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you ar on that could be black women todai asian homosexu tommorrow and ye inde white men some yet to be determin dai when the balanc of the pie ha final swung against that 39% minor or you can just blow the whole thing off and sai as do most conserv and all the libertarian and act is if you didn t care who s win and who s lose in some case you might sai someth about make sure the game is fair equal of opportun not of condit in the latter case you might be abl to identifi yourself as a neoconserv or a neoliber depend on how much you want to limit the pot either wai you go the wai of the winner is no longer the wai to be popular at least after you graduat from high school but you ll still be popular at high school reunion but it beat be a nerd as i would imagin michael dougla would now agre and in the long run it is the onli wai to go even in hollywood which treat loser wors than ani other place in america except for new york and washington d c and even in columbu ohio which produc alex keaton but no champion footbal team in the eighti and the first quarter of the nineti i d like to see more winner in thi societi regardless of race gender religi prefer and sexual orient mayb we should even let a few more of them be white men we should definit let the buckey win the rose bowl somedai bill r the onli propos in the senat that i my opinion do not repres have seen fit to mention ar particularli those of my employ or praiseworthi or particularli scandal on ani govern agenc it seem to me that the historian s foremost bill rigg duti is to ensur that virtu is rememb and to deter evil word and deed with the fear of poster s damnat tacitu _annal_ iii 65
