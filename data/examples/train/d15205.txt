the concept of god as a teacher is inde interest doe he grade on a curv doe he cheat that is interest not to mention thought provok my own concept is that he is a father and we ar hi children in that he love us with a love that we can never understand until we ar with him the bibl sai that he look on the heart as the final measur from that perspect in a grade context the heart is the final test specif most christian would agre that there is onli on heaven and on hell from that perspect it is heaven or hell you either go to on or the other the grade on a pass fail basi is done by god the father with intervent by jesu the son not by other for onli god see the heart the bibl sai of the heart who can know it i would sai there ha alwai been and alwai be an unchang method that is what make a relationship with christ so secur in an uncertain and ever chang landscap he is alwai the same yesterdai todai and tomorrow concern whether or not our childhood ar considerd as part of the test my own convict is no were that the case i certainli wouldn t be go to heaven the bibl speak veri plainli about the love and care jesu had for and about children the realiti is that we ar all children some of us just have bigger bodi and grei hair but the father our father is alwai there like most father he want onli the best for hi own there mayb deciplin but there is more love it s sometim look like christian is a test to see who make it and who doesn t those who do pass heaven and those who don t go to the other place but it is realli much more than that there ar few expert most of us ar just travel look for the light and the wai home prai that we can bring other with us
