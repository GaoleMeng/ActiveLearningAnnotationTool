fcrari ucsu colorado edu frank crari write down to 170 some odd line we must be make progress on an iron note where i delet line emac continu gave me the messag garbag collect done think it s try to tell me someth vike iastat edu dan sorenson write and thank you it s a great chang from the same tire old debat you lurker can join in at ani time you know ahhh talk polit gun the kindler gentler newsgroup who would have thought no not exactli the onli reason for thi sort of restrict is the possibl endanger of other a poorli maintain rifl is danger but onli to the user sinc it doesn t endang other there is no justif for such restrict i remind you of shrapnel i consid 5 a reason space limit but make no mistak a gun blow up is a hazard to those nearbi sai in the next lane at the rang my point wa at what distanc or level of threat we draw the line is it the endanger of other so we do a 5 restrict or the possibl of be shot henc we draw a 1 5 mile restrict or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restrict to me thei al suffer from the fundament flaw that thei restrict base upon the instrument rather than place the respons for usag squar upon the shoulder of the user perhap sen metzenbaum declar the barrett light fifti an assault rifl ha made thi more appar to me sinc the barrett ha onli rang and acurraci go for it thei have determin that their live ar worth the effort to protect their home and famili us nuclear weapon close to home will not accomplish thi i disagre on the ground that a hous can be rebuilt much more easili than my famili onc i have di i assum that word would get to the citizen that such an attack wa plan if thi is not the case the tactic and strateg implic chang quit a bit person my home is worth sai twenti martian intent on take over the world my famili all of them the balanc act here is hard to judg sit at my desk there is howev anoth problem in ani case of civil war the strength of the militia fight on each side should reflect the popular will if the public is split 67% versu 33% then the minor militia should be at a 2 1 disadvantag such a need for popular support would hopefulli prevent insurrect unless the peopl realli were behind the rebel but heavi weapon own by a small fraction of the militia could distort thi what if the 33% minor includ all the tank and artilleri owner that seem to be the case alreadi given that heavi weapon aren t commonli own by the citizenri with such low number obvious due to cost i don t think the superior weapon ar go to be of great effect against a numer superior foe furthermor it is even more doubt their train includ proper tactic movement that best util tank wherea the commonli rifleman is not so hamper in effect i think it is vital to avoid such a situat where a small minor would have a reason chanc of gain polit power through violenc to prevent thi it mai be necessari to give control of heavi weapon e g those which onli a small number of individu would own _and_ whose firepow would grossli distort the relat between popular support and militari strength to someon other that individu militiamen thi is certainli not a good thing but i think it is the lesser of two evil whoever control these weapon must be a democrat bodi respons to the will of the peopl i had envis that the armor perhap the offic of a select group and the like would exercis control over the heavier more complex weapon but if joe bob own an old sherman tank i certainli wouldn t ask him to give it up follow order from the offic ye sinc the expens of a tank is so larg though chanc ar it would be jointli purchas and should therefor be jointli maintain and oper here i think we have to be careful about _which_ state we ar talk about certainli on role of the militia is to overthrow a repress govern and it would be complet destruct to that end for that same govern to control the militia s arm but the unit state have sever level of govern each abl to act independ but not all like target of rebelion as such rebelion against state and local govern ar veri unlik i think therefor that the state or possibl local govern could safe be allow to keep the select militia s heavi weapon the risk of abus while still someth to consid is far less than the similar risk were the feder govern in control thi i ll agre with to a point the state have control over the heavi weapon should not be justif for the state to have them central locat keep them spread out such that the abil of the state to lock them up isn t so easi otherwis i would have to assum that state control would rest on the author of the governor and militia offic that is eaxctli why i think thei should be remov the select militia should privid the militia s heavi weapon and highli train specialist for the reason i have outlin abov i think these heavi weapon tank artilleri aircraft etc ar better off be kept by local govern than by a small number of individu howev local govern shouldn t be abl to us the select militia without the support to the peopl ideal the gener militia under the direct control of the peopl and the select militia under the direct of democrat local govern would opper togeth but even in the worst case the gener militia should be abl to function without the select militia similarli the select militia should be incap of action without the aid of the gener militia i m have a hard time see how these heavi weapon fairli few in number could not be easili wield by a few peopl with govern support just as you argu abov that the weapon should be divvi up and under democrat control so on side doesn t have all of them i can t see where thi situat is allevi in have the select militia hold all the weapon and the unorgan militia be the infantri i think a better mix is call for but i would argu that the feder armi should reli upon the select militia and the unorgan militia for the bulk of it infantri unit consid then the effect of remov the nation guard s infantri and place the guard under the control of local govern the govern control select militia could not fight effect without infantri support provid by the gener militia an inher infantri organ on the other hand the gener militia could function although at a disadvantag without the back of local govern and the select militia we have to assum that there would be those who would side with the govern control forc and if thei ve all the equip an infantri forc 3x the size would be in troubl i d like to see that heavi stuff sai tank offset by the local troup have a few 105 s and anti tank weapon in their armori these would be much more us to infantri than the tank would be when cost and train requir ar figur in i suppos i m quibbl over what constitut heavi equip but a mechan infantri unit is what build dike in time of flood set up disast relief citi and the like i would much rather see these thing handl by the local gener militia so would i but the resourc often aren t avail to outfit local unit well enough thu we will certainli have to call in other and a mechan unit carri more stuff faster than anyth els perhap the nation guard isn t as close to my concept of the select militia as i thought i wa consid them to be the heavi weapon armor arm of the militia not the infantri arm of the regular armi perhap our idea of heavi weapon ar differ i think main battl tank self propel artilleri and 155mm and up field piec ar heavi stuff m113 troop carrier 2 1 2 ton truck humve s old m60 tank 105 howitz ar more the stuff of a mechan infantri actual thi is what the guard unit in iowa ar current field in some unit perhap it is just my innat fear of have the real heavi equip under state control with littl but number and light stuff to act as a deterr allow main battl tank to the state should be balanc with anti tank capabl in the local rank similarli local unit would need to band togeth quickli henc small and fast respons mean mechan infantri final the militia is more than just fight equip is need for other respons the feder armi i m convinc should have a veri minumum of infantri reli on the state and local militia for these function dan sorenson dod 1066 z1dan exnet iastat edu vike iastat edu isu onli censor what i read not
