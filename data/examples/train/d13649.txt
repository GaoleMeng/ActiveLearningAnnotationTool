i ve been to three talk in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcrib some of my note below sinc my note take abil is by no mean infal pleas assum that all factual error ar mine permiss is grant to copi thi without restrict michael sternberg cheif of oper of rimsat wa invit to speak at an inform lunch held by acdi here on the campu of the univers of illinoi acdi is an organ on campu that deal with arm control disarma and intern secur rimsat wa consid an appropri topic becaus the compani is us russian launcher and satellit i think it also help that hi daughter is a grad student in the intern relat program the concept behind rimsat appar began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he wa there he somehow end up visit the king who happen to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellit dish which the king thought wa realli nifti sinc tonga ha a gnp of about $70 million hi majesti ask if there wa ani wai to make monei off thi matt thought there probabl wa so at hi suggest tonga appli for 31 geosynchron satellit slot while thi isn t entir off the wall it wa veri unusu see as tonga wa a tini kingdom with no space program and 31 is a lot of slot the whole thing wa debat in the appropri regulatori agenc and carl hilliard who is appar a respect space lawyer wrote sever opinion support tonga s case eventu tonga end up with 7 slot rang from 70 e to 170 e slot ar design by the longitud over which thei resid accord to sternberg four of these from 130 e to 142 e ar the best in the world becaus thei ar excel place for commun between hawaii and the pacif rim rimsat wa form to us these slot it wa offici form in nevi as a tax haven thei tri for a few year to rais fund in the west howev to fill 7 slot with western satellit launch on western launcher would have cost approxim $2 billion it s not easi to rais that kind of monei eventu thei hit upon the idea of us russian hardwar thei began negoti with glavkosmo for hardwar mr sternberg describ oper in moscow in such harsh term that i don t think i ll visit there for a long time besid a signific lack of creatur comfort he wa not happi with the wai that peopl oper for exampl everybodi can sell you everyth everyon can show the proper document and licens that indic thei ar the onli on who have the author to sell what ever you want to by eventu rimsat arrang a deal with glavkosmo for 6 satellit at a cost of $150 million howev glavkosmo lost favor after the coup sternberg sai that thi is becaus thei were basic a bunch of kgb oper who went to trade show and pick up lot of brochur sinc glavkosmo wa out of power he had to renegoti the deal with the new author he again describ life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavor term eventu he work out a deal and on dec 4 1992 he met with koptev who head the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insist on a few concess befor sign and accord to sternberg he arrang these new rule to allow himself to form anoth compani to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step wa to meet with the builder of the hardwar npo appli mechan npo pm to us their acronym thi organ is locat in siberia can t figur out how to spell the town i need an atla and ha built about 1500 vehicl sinc the dawn of the space ag sternberg comment that siberian ar veri differ from musovit thei ar hard worker honest peopl who team up to get thing done veri much like midwestern at thi point there were some comment from the audienc that agre with hi opinion on both siberian and midwestern sternberg had lot of good thing to sai about npo pm hi compani is appar lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to becom 50% partner it appar cost the russian about $4 million to build a satellit that would sell for $50 million in the west if you want to give them specif thei ll build you a satellit for the particular satellit that rimsat will be us cost run about $378 000 per transpond year thi compar to $810 000 t y in the u s thei can sell their time for about $1 1 million compar to $2 6 million in the u s rimsat will launch their satellit on proton to get the best price thei bought in bulk thei have the right to twelv launch so if ani of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is schedul for octob and thei ar get on us satellit from the russian which is be move into place now tidbit sternberg sai thi kind of thing ha to be done by entrepreneur not big busi becaus big busi is just like what thei have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launch ar self insur the promis to replac a fail launch within 9 month major investor in rimsat includ russel 20 20 which is a huge retir fund organ cellsat which is a big telecom busi in southeast asia and a fund oper by some of the big name in u s aerospac which he sai is sort of an insur polici for them if thi realli take off he downplai the instabilit in the ex ussr sai that we ar worri partli becaus we aren t us to see russia as anyth but an unvari monolith itali get a new govern everi two week but we don t worri becaus we re us to it he predict that onc we get us to see what realli goe on in russia we won t worri about their stabil as much part of the problem with cooper ventur is the problem of transfer monei the central bank ha a polici of take hard currenc payment put 25% in their coffer and replac the rest with the equival valu in rubl to get around thi rimsat pai their hard currenc into an austrian bank account npo pm then pai their contractor with foreign currenc so that the onli the contractor get swindl by the govern on of the big problem rimsat ha had is stonewal by the western satellit industri howev intelsat recent bought three of the same type of satellit which wa rather reassur the biggest worri most peopl have about russian satellit is the primit technolog and shorter lifetim the older gorizont horizon satellit have a lifetim of about 5 year while the more modern express satellit compar well with western technolog and last about 8 year while thi is much shorter than 15 year for western satellit sternberg downplai the differ at these price thei can afford to launch new on in addit shorter lifetim mean that thei can replac their equip with newer technolog so thei will be abl to compet better than older out of date hardwar josh hopkin jbh55289 uxa cso uiuc edu find a
