diner syndrom or the and other natur flavor syndrom it s been a few year sinc i ve bought anyth label with and other natur flavor from kiran villag com kiran wagl the reaction came the time the msg wa in the food that wa the onli differ same restaur same ingredi how do you know thi in order to demonstr your claim you would have had to supervis the prepar on both occas perhap thei us msg both time

that the situat is not alwai as simpl as it might seem which wa why i start check everi time i got sick and everi time i got sick msg wa somehow involv in on of the food product and consid there were no other similar ingredi to my knowledg it might not pleas a medic research but it pleas my own person physician enough for him to give me allergi medicin and most importantli it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incred frugal fianc didn t flinch when i liter threw out or gave awai all the food product in hi pantri that had msg and he alwai flinch when there s wast but it wa a simpl explan i won t eat thi stuff i won t cook with thi stuff so i can either throw it out or give it awai from patte ucsu colorado edu donna patte my guess wa that the spice mix on the fri contain msg probabl lawri s season salt i love the wai that tast i m not sai i never consum anyth with msg i ve notic that i have a certain toler level like a small bag of bbq chip onc a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chip will bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterdai and lunch at on of the chines restaur the dai befor from kellei healthi uwaterloo ca catherin l kellei all that s need now is that final step a doubl blind studi done on human there isn t even an ethic question about possibl harm as thi is a wide us and approv food addit but some sai that onli 2% of the popul ha a problem with msg some sai it s more like 20% but let s sai that it s 5% how mani peopl would have to be test that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunt for a test like thank gui but i don t want to get sick also i m sure that most peopl probabl have vari degre of sensit at differ time if i have a cold i m much more suscept to the reaction than when i m healthi as proven todai when i m stuffi but for some silli reason i still gave in and decid to have the bbq chip from kiran villag com kiran wagl becaus too mani of you gener rhetor you not you cathi go around call thi chines restaur syndrom thu suggest to the peopl you complain to that you experi thi onli from chines food msg is preval in a lot more thing than chines food that why i suggest call thi diner syndrom cathi doesn t i haven t save all my post but i never call it chines restaur syndrom and i never state i got it onli from chines food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my person test at a chines take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i can t call up whoever make dorito and ask them to make me on back of chip without msg on the other hand if on complain about potato from a mix or restaur spice mix i m go to believ them and if anyon sai thei got msg sick after eat too mani barbecu potato chip at a parti i m realli go to believ them well i believ i mention that in an earlier post let s see you wrote thi messag at date 20 apr 1993 00 09 31 0500 but on date 19 apr 1993 16 33 18 gmt i wrote ha anyon had an msg reaction from someth other than a chines restaur lot of time that s why it wa so hard for me to pin down i would probabl have been easier if i d onli have the reaction in a certain type of restaur but i ve had the reaction in chines restaur and greek restaur and italian restaur and steak place i can tell you when a steak joint us accent to tender their meat oh and just in case anyon think i m prejudic against either chines food or asian peopl i m not go home to cook some chines food for the gui i m marri next week incident hi last name is wu so stop it with the flame mail why doe a woman work ten
