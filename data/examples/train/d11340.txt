archiv name cryptographi faq part03 last modifi 1993 4 15 faq for sci crypt part 3 basic cryptolog thi is the third of ten part of the sci crypt faq the part ar mostli independ but you should read the first part befor the rest we don t have the time to send out miss part by mail so don t ask note such as kah67 refer to the refer list in the last part the section of thi faq ar avail via anonym ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet new answer cryptographi faq part xx the cryptographi faq is post to the newsgroup sci crypt sci answer and new answer everi 21 dai content what is cryptolog cryptographi plaintext ciphertext encrypt kei what refer can i start with to learn cryptolog how doe on go about cryptanalysi what is a brute forc search and what is it cryptograph relev what ar some properti satisfi by everi strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem is theoret unbreak then is it guarante analysi proof in practic why ar mani peopl still us cryptosystem that ar rel easi to break what is cryptolog cryptographi plaintext ciphertext encrypt kei the stori begin when juliu caesar sent messag to hi trust acquaint he didn t trust the messeng so he replac everi a by a c everi b by a d and so on through the alphabet onli someon who knew the shift by 2 rule could deciph hi messag a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguis messag so that onli certain peopl can see through the disguis cryptographi is the art of creat and us cryptosystem cryptanalysi is the art of break cryptosystem see through the disguis even when you re not suppos to be abl to cryptolog is the studi of both cryptographi and cryptanalysi the origin messag is call a plaintext the disguis messag is call a ciphertext encrypt mean ani procedur to convert plaintext into ciphertext decrypt mean ani procedur to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usual a whole collect of algorithm the algorithm ar label the label ar call kei for instanc caesar probabl us shift by n encrypt for sever differ valu of n it s natur to sai that n is the kei here the peopl who ar suppos to be abl to see through the disguis ar call recipi other peopl ar enemi oppon interlop eavesdropp or third parti what refer can i start with to learn cryptolog for an introduct to technic matter the survei articl given in part 10 ar the best place to begin as thei ar in gener concis author by compet peopl and well written howev these articl ar mostli concern with cryptolog as it ha develop in the last 50 year or so and ar more abstract and mathemat than histor the codebreak by kahn kah67 is encycloped in it histori and technic detail of cryptolog up to the mid 60 s introductori cryptanalysi can be learn from gain gai44 or sinkov sin66 thi is recommend especi for peopl who want to devis their own encrypt algorithm sinc it is a common mistak to try to make a system befor know how to break on the select of an algorithm for the de drew the attent of mani public research to problem in cryptolog consequ sever textbook and book to serv as text have appear the book of den den82 give a good introduct to a broad rang of secur includ encrypt algorithm databas secur access control and formal model of secur similar comment appli to the book of price davi pri84 and pfleeger pfl89 the book of konheim kon81 and meyer matya mei82 ar quit technic book both konheim and meyer were directli involv in the develop of de and both book give a thorough analysi of de konheim s book is quit mathemat with detail analys of mani classic cryptosystem meyer and matya concentr on modern cryptograph method especi pertain to kei manag and the integr of secur facil into comput system and network the book of rueppel rue86 and koblitz kob89 concentr on the applic of number theori and algebra to cryptographi how doe on go about cryptanalysi classic cryptanalysi involv an interest combin of analyt reason applic of mathemat tool pattern find patienc determin and luck the best avail textbook on the subject ar the militari cryptanalyt seri frie1 it is clear that profici in cryptanalysi is for the most part gain through the attempt solut of given system such experi is consid so valuabl that some of the cryptanalys perform dure wwii by the alli ar still classifi modern public kei cryptanalysi mai consist of factor an integ or take a discret logarithm these ar not the tradit fare of the cryptanalyst comput number theorist ar some of the most success cryptanalyst against public kei system what is a brute forc search and what is it cryptograph relev in a nutshel if f x y and you know y and can comput f you can find x by try everi possibl x that s brute forc search exampl sai a cryptanalyst ha found a plaintext and a correspond ciphertext but doesn t know the kei he can simpli try encrypt the plaintext us each possibl kei until the ciphertext match or decrypt the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichev is faster everi well design cryptosystem ha such a larg kei space that thi brute forc search is impract advanc in technolog sometim chang what is consid practic for exampl de which ha been in us for over 10 year now ha 2 56 or about 10 17 possibl kei a comput with thi mani oper wa certainli unlik for most user in the mid 70 s the situat is veri differ todai given the dramat decreas in cost per processor oper massiv parallel machin threaten the secur of de against brute forc search some scenario ar describ by garron and outerbridg gar91 on phase of a more sophist cryptanalysi mai involv a brute forc search of some manag small space of possibl what ar some properti satisfi by everi strong cryptosystem the secur of a strong system resid with the secreci of the kei rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem ha a larg keyspac as mention abov the unic distanc is a measur which give the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercept to uniqu identifi the kei and if for some kei the unic distanc is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that kei the system is probabl strong a strong cryptosystem will certainli produc ciphertext which appear random to all standard statist test see for exampl cae90 a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previou attack a system which ha never been subject to scrutini is suspect if a system pass all the test mention abov is it necessarili strong certainli not mani weak cryptosystem look good at first howev sometim it is possibl to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathemat proof if joe can break thi system then he can also solv the well known difficult problem of factor integ see part 6 fail that it s a crap shoot if a cryptosystem is theoret unbreak then is it guarante analysi proof in practic cryptanalyt method includ what is known as practic cryptanalysi the enemi doesn t have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figur out the plaintext for instanc he might assum crib stretch of probabl plaintext if the crib is correct then he might be abl to deduc the kei and then deciph the rest of the messag or he might exploit isolog the same plaintext enciph in sever cryptosystem or sever kei thu he might obtain solut even when cryptanalyt theori sai he doesn t have a chanc sometim cryptosystem malfunct or ar misus the on time pad for exampl lose all secur if it is us more than onc even chosen plaintext attack where the enemi somehow feed plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduc the kei have been emploi see kah67 why ar mani peopl still us cryptosystem that ar rel easi to break some don t know ani better often amateur think thei can design secur system and ar not awar of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometim there is insuffici motiv for anybodi to invest the work need to crack a system
