robert i m so glad that you post your biolog alchemi discuss i ve been compar to the famou robert mcelwain by some reader of sci med i didn t know how to respond sinc i had not seen on of your post just like i haven t read the yeast connect let me just start by state that the author of the cold fusion paper of recent year ar now in scientif exil i believ that on ha actual left the countri scientif fraud is rare i m still not sure that if a review of the research note of the cold fusion scientist actual prove fraud or just veri shoddi experiment your sourc do not seem to be research articl thei ar more like lai text design to piqu human interest in a subject area just like the food combin and life extens text robert i try to keep an open mind but some thing i just can t bui on is take sod oral to prevent oxid damag in the bodi your experi if conduct by reader of thi new group would prove that you ar right more ash after seed sprout than befor unless you us a muffl furnanc and obtain a veri high temperatur abov 600 degre i believ you will get organ residu in the ash even the residu in commerci inciner contain organ residu i rememb do thi kind of experi in my organ chemistri couurs in colleg but i couldn t find a temperatur for miner ash format so i m realli guess at 600 degre f it mai actual be much higher the point is that no on in their home could ever get a high enough temperatur to produc onli a miner ash thei also could not measur the miner so thei could onli weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemic reaction abound in our bodi in our atmospher in our water and in our soil ar these fusion reaction ye mani of them do involv fuse oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organ and inorgan do we realli have the transform of silicon to calcium if carbon is fuse with silicon not in my book robert silicon is the most abund miner on our planet i ve seen specul that man could have evolv to be a silicon base rather than a carbon base life form i like read scienc fiction as mani peopl do but i know enough about biochemistri and nutrit to be abl in most case to separ the fiction from the fact silicon mai be on of the trace element that turn out to be essenti in human we have sever gram of the stuff in our bodi what s it do there onli the lord know right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why as you state it help bone heal and it is not becaus silicon is transform into calcium almost all of the silicon in the human bodi is found in the connect tissu collagen and elastin there have been studi publish which show that the veri high silicon content in elastin mai be an import protect factor against atherosclerosi the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resist the elastin is to a an ag relat loss of elast which mai plai a role in the increas in blood pressur that is often seen as part of the ag process in human for bone fractur heal the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphat ar pump by osteoblast a high level of silicon in the diet seem to speed up thi matrix format thi first step in the bone heal process seem to be the hardest for some peopl to get go electriacl current have been us in an attempt to get the matrix form cell orient in the right direct so that the matrix can be form in the gap or gap between the end of the broken bone a vitamin c defici by slow collagen format as well as caus the prodcut of defect collagen doe slow down both bone and wound heal zinc is also anoth big player in bone and wound heal and so is silicon in an undetermin role that most like invol matrix format and not transform of silicon to calcium for you to take thi bone heal observ and us it as proof that silicon is transform into calcium is an interest littl trick but robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lai press and ye even some scientif paper is the explan reason without a veri good scienc knowledg base you and most reader of thi new group ar fly blind you have to take it on faith becaus you don t know ani better if the explan seem to make sens to me base on my knowledg base i m inclin to consid it thi usual mean try to find other sourc that come to the same conclus if the idea like a candida bloom seem to make sens to me i tend to pursu it as long as ani advic that i m go to give isn t go to realli mess somebodi up if thi make us kindr soul robert then i guess i ll have to live with that label for the physician who have decid to read my respons to robert s interest post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatr neurosurgeon last night on u s tv i can t rememb the network or hi name like mani night i wa on my comput and my wife wa watch tv in our den where i have my comput setup thi neurosurgeon take kid with brain tumor that everyon els ha given up on and he us unconvent treatment hi own word he sai that he ha a 70% success rate the on case that i heard him discuss would normal us radiat convent treatment he wa go to go in and cut you gui complain about the cost of the anti fungal what do you think the cost differ between radiat treatment and surgeri is gui i m go to ask you gui on more time why blast a physician who take the chronic sinu suffer like jon and the chronic gi suffer like elain and tri to help them us unconvent treatment treatment which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon us is it becaus candida bloom ar not life threaten while brain tumor ar how about qualiti of life gui mai the candida demon never cross your sinu caviti or gut if it doe you mai feel differ about the issu marti b
