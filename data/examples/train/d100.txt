will munni unforgiven 61 i am beyond the under 25 ag group but i have an experi a few year ago that might be interest to you i own a 1985 toyota celica gt i decid to bui myself a gift a more exot car front runner includ the toyota supra turbo and the porsch 924 1987 model year i narrow it down to those two i like the simplic and handl and snob appeal too of drive a porsch the supra turbo wa less monei and had more featur and perform almost a person luxuri car it had better acceler and a higher top speed than the 924 i wa almost readi to give in to a bui impuls for the 924 but i decid to stop by my insur agent s offic on the wai i ask about what would happen to my rate with either car if you bui the supra your rate classif will be the same as the celica the 85 celica wa consid a subcompact and for that year wa rate as on of the safest car with a slight increas becaus the car will be 2 year newer our lower risk divis will continu to handl your account if you bui the porsch 924 we ll have to chang you to the standard higher rate compani and your rate will doubl and if you go with a 944 it s anoth stori again we ll cover the rest of thi year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the 924 and the 924 is actual faster than the standard 944 that doen t make sens that s what the book sai we don t insur corvett either for some reason the underwrit consid supra and their driver as veri tradit and conserv i eventu went with the supra for a number of reason the porsch dealer had a nice salesman to get me interest but a tough high pressur gui in the back room at equal monthli payment it would have taken a year longer to pai for the porsch plu it higher insur i conclud that the high insur wa relat to probabl of auto theft everyon s entitl to my opinion _ _ _ _
