guerilla us the popul for cover israel should total back down so the easiest wai to get awai with attack anoth is to us an innoc as a shield and hope that the other respect innoc live tell me tim what ar these guerilla do wrong assum that thei ar us civilian for cover assum also come on brad if we ar go to get anywher in thi or ani discuss it doesn t help to bring up element i never address nor comment on in ani wai i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong onli that civilian ar be us as cover and that have been place in between the isra and the guerilla thei will be injur as both parti continu their fight the purpos of an armi s us of militari uniform is to set it member apart from the civilian so that civilian will not be thought of by the other side as combat so what do you think is the mean behind the intent and the effect when an armi purpos doe not were uniform but goe out of it wai to look like civilian thei ar judg that the benefit thei will receiv from thi cover is more import that the harm that will come to civilian thi is a comment on the isra experi and is sai that the guerilla do have some respons in put civilian in the middl of thi fight by put on uniform and live apart from civilian barrack etc the guerilla would significantli lower the risk to civilian but if the guerilla do thi aren t thei put themselv at greater risk absolut thei ask themselv why set ourselv apart by wear uniform when there is a readi made cover for us civilian that make sens from their point of view but when thi cover is us the guerilla should accept some of the respons for subsequ harm to civilian if the buffer zone is to prevent attack on israel is it not work why is it further neccessari for isra gun to pound lebanes villag why not just kill those who try to infiltr the buffer zone you see there is more to the shell of the villag it is call retali get back get even it doesn t make sens to shell the villag the least it show is a reckless disregard by the isra govern for the live of civilian i agre with you here i have alwai thought that israel s bomb sorte and bomb polici is stupid thoughtless inhuman and ineffect but there is no reason that israel should passiv wait until attack chose to act there is everi reason to believ that take the fight to the enemi will do more to stop attack as i said previous israel spent sever decad sit passiv on it side of a border and onli act to stop these attack after the attack had enter isra territori it didn t work veri well the host arab state did littl noth to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel so the number of attack were consider higher as wa their physic and psycholog impact on the civilian caught in their path what so the whole bit about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will onli occur when arab state show that thei ar prepar to take on the respons and the duti to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil thei have to prove it or provid some guarate there is no wai israel is go to accept their word not with their past attitud of toler toward anti israel guerilla in resid if israel is not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busi wast other time come to the peac talk thi is just anoth select appli statement the reason for thi drawn out impass between abab palestinian and isra is that neither side is will to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyon should stai awai from the negoti that is precis why the palestinian in their recent pisga propos for the interim period after negoti and lead up to full autonomi ar demand condit that essenti defin autonomi alreadi thei do not trust that israel will follow through the entir process and allow palestinian to reach full autonomi do you understand and accept thi viewpoint by the palestinian if you do then why should israel s view of arab palestinian be ani differ why should thei trust the arab palestinian word sinc thei don t thei ar veri reluct to give up tangibl asset land control of area in exchang for word for thi reason thei ar also concern about the sort of guarante thei will have that the arab will follow through on their part of ani agreement reach but don t you see that the same statement can be made both wai if lebanon wa interest in peac then it should accept the word of israel that the attack were the caus for war and disarm the hizbollah will remov the caus for it continu occup absolut so ar the arab palestinian ask first for the isra word in relat to ani agreement no what is be demand first is land when the issu is land and on parti final get hold of thi land what the other parti doe is total irrelev if i now have possess of thi land your word have absolut no power whether israel choos to keep it word doe not get the land back afteral israel ha alreadi stage two part of the withdraw from area it occupi in lebanon dure slg tim you ar ignor the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have been disarm hezbollah remain the onli independ militia hezbollah doe not attack israel except at a few time such as when the idf burn up sheikh mosavi hi wife and young son while the major armament those allow peopl to wage civil war have been remov the weapon need to cross border attack still remain to some extent rocket attack still continu and commando raid onli requir a few easili conceal weapon and a refin disregard for human life your of that of other such attack also continu of cours if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassin peopl and shell villag thei wouldn t make the lebanes so mad as to do that bat guano the situat you call for exist in the 1970s and attack were commonplac furthermor with hezbollah subsequ disarm it would not be possibl there is no wai these group can be effect disarm unless the state is as authoritarian is syria s the onli other wai is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantli patrol the entir border with israel essenti mirror israel s border secir on it side it ha to prove to isreal that it is thi commit to protect israel from attack from lebanes territori onc syria leav who is to sai that lebanon will be abl to retain control if syria stai thai mai be even more danger for israel tim when is the last time that you recal ani troubl on the syrian border not late eh that s what i said ok but doesn t that mean that syria ha to take over lebanon i don t think israel or lebanon would like that what both side need is to receiv someth tangibl the arab palestinian ar look for land and demand that thei receiv it prior to give anyth to israel israel ha two problem 1 if it give up real land it is expos itself to a chang geostrateg situat and that chang doesn t help israel s posit and 2 when it give up thi land it need to receiv someth in return to compens for the increas risk tim
