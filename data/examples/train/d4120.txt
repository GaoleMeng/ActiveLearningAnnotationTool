livesei solntz wpd sgi com jon livesei write much though it might be fun to debat capit punish itself thi is probabl the wrong group for it the onli relev here is that you don t seem to be abl to tell us what capit punish actual is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you ar us a term you have not yet defin well i ve said that when an innoc person ha been execut thi is object a murder howev who is at blame is anoth question it seem that the entir societi that sanction ani sort of execut realiz the risk is to blame there is a probabl of kill an innoc person by shoot at random into the air and there is a probabl of kill an innoc person when the state administ a system of capit punish so when you do either you know that thei action you ar take will sooner or later result in the kill of an innoc person ye but there is also a probabl that you will kill someon do ani raondom activ presum you had not isol yourself total from the rest of societi becaus of thi and drive will kill peopl as will airlin but peopl continu to do both drive and fly ar not punish inflict on unwil prison by court thei ar risk that we take upon ourselv willingli and i argu that our law system is a similar risk perhap an innoc person will be punish somedai but we work to prevent thi in fact mani crimin go free as a result of our try to prevent punish of innoc if our own drive kill someon els then sure there is a moral issu i know at least on person who wa involv in a fatal accid and thei felt vei guilti afterward but such accid ar to be total expect given the numner of vehic on the road again the blame is on societi no i m not thi is what you said you were sai that if there were such a fals wit that result in an innoc person be convict and kill it would still be the fault of the state sinc it did the actual kill no i just comment that the state doe the kill it doe not depend on there be fals wit how could it the state doe the kill even in the case of sincer mistak ye but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can onli do so much to prevent fals wit it is possibl so what ar you try to sai that capit punish is alwai murder becaus of the possibilti of human error invalid the system i m sai capit punish is murder period not becaus of thi that and the other but becaus it involv take human life that s my definit of murder i make no appeal to dictionari or to object moral okai so thi is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murder ar wrong ar you sai that all take of human life is wrong no matter what the circumst if we as a societi decid to murder someon then we should sai that and list our reason for do so and live with the moral consequ we should not plai word game and pretend that murder isn t murder and that s my opinion about how societi ought to be run but thi is basic how it work societi accept the risk that an innoc person will be murder by execut and everi member of societi share thi blame and most peopl s definit of murder includ some sort of malici intent which is not involv in an execut is it but we were try to discuss an object moral system or at least it possibilti what ramif doe your person system have on an object on no we were not discuss an object moral system i wa show you that you didn t have on becaus for on thing you were incap of defin the term in it for exampl murder murder violat the golden rule execut do not becaus by allow it at all societi implicitli accept the consequ no matter who the innoc victim is we re not talk about read mind we ar just talk about know the truth ye we can never be absolut certain that we have the truth but the court system work on a principl of know the truth beyond a reason doubt sorri but you simpli ar not quot yourself accur here is what you said
