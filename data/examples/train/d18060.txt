propaganda and it is therefor difficult to determin precis what maddison etc were up to from them there ar a coupl of wai to look at them on is we want you to support thi constitut so we ll sai anyth that we think will appeal to you or the more straightforward thi is why we think what we ve suggest in thi constitut is a good idea you clearli consid the former to be the primari situat the point is that thei did not make pain to point out where the consitut mai have been aginst the new yorker s interest also thei did not want to rais opposit by base their advocaci on unpopular principl horror appeal to popular principl can we perhap as the question of whether the constitut might have been written to appeal to the principl rather than as you appear to believ it wa written with someth els in mind and propoganda put out by it support but let s be honest about someth here when wa the last time you brought up all the valid point against your own argument or ar thei simpli propogranda we can t know what phill realli mean becaus he s obvious us argument design to convinc well i know hamilton wa a dy in the wool monarchist and probabl the authoritarian extrem to jefferson s democrat impul but what would you suggest as a mean of determin their opinion on the govern if we don t consid what thei wrote about the govern i don t propos that ani mean exist for determin their true opinion thu their true opinion di with them and ar of littl help todai their opinion have not the slightest bear on the matter though onli their argument these ar true or fals regardless of who said them or why if thei re true or fals regardl of why thei were said why on earth did you make a point of call them propogranda that would seem to be irrelev the difficulti that most us poster seem to have is in consid that their argument mai have been flaw or no longer appli to modern societi oh i have no argument with question them i don t believ thei no longer appli but that s becaus i think most of them were good argument i m not entir happi about the situat becaus thei were obvious onli appli to a minor of the time but i don t think that alon is suffici to invalid them if thei were aliv todai the on opinion we could count upon these men to express is that a care studi of the mechan of govern is necessari and that an ongo improv of the same is requir thei gave their opinion in certain area and have been prove right in other area thei got it wrong thei ensur that there wa a mechan to adapt and improv the consititut thi can onli happen if there is a willing to accept that the structur problem within the us polit system mai requir constitut chang as a solut sinc the u s constitut is the basi for the u s polit system most chang in it would requir constitut chang in thi particular case howev the fillibust is a matter of procedur and tradit it onli should have been made part of the constitut if the senat wa less power than the hous of lord than we d almost have to state that the hous of repres wa also in fact thei both were becaus the british govern had much greater power than did the american system in principl no in practic ye in principl no that thei had less power of that thei should have had less power the british govern todai is theoreticali depend on the will of the monarch by convent ani monarch seek to exercis that power is depos the subtli is that the prime minist is not abl to identifi their polit with the nation interest in the same manner that us presid regularli do phill we re discus the power of legisl hous while the prime minist is member of parliament he is more analg although badli to the u s presid now pleas explain to me how the u s hous of repres is in principl more power than the hous of lord or the senat but in practic is less ar you suggest that the writer of the constitut realli intend for them to be more power but gosh darn the thing wa ratifi befor thei realiz thei d forgotten to put those extra restrict on the senat in i disagre the system is not too slow it wa simpli design to handl less than it ha demand that it handl as somebodi in washington put it whose name i forget congress ha becom everybodi s citi council on reason for that is that at everi level the govern is render unabl to come to decis these decis ar push up to the next higher level instead not at all as ani entri level polit scienc cours will tell you peopl who want law implement will alwai choos the level of govern to attack which present them with the best chanc of get what thei want with nation interest group it is simpli a veri ration thing to do to want the feder govern to enact a law rather than the state less peopl to persuad and less contribut to make why do those concern about abort primarili concentr at the feder level simpli becaus if thei win that battl all the littl state battlefield ar won by extens the same extend to insur medicin and most other question local govern ha not fail in that it hasn t done what it should but that it is domin by local interest thu non local interest who want local to abid by their rule can t get their rule past the local govern thu sinc thei ve got more clout onli in the wrong place thei appeal to the next higher level becaus it can impos it will on the lower i mean let s get real here do we realli need the congr of the unit state decid that x traffic light should be on thu and such pattern or that carjack need to be a feder as oppos to a local crime the more peopl want the more congress will take power to sell it to them for their vote i don t think the rise of special interest is coincid with the increas power of congress congress is more than capabl of quick action and ha more than enough power and time on it hand if it confin itself to what it origin jurisidict wa and allow more local autonomi if thei were to start from a social welfar model instead of the current no state subsidi motto thei would be better place as it is there is plenti of state monei be hand out the problem is that it is distribut on the basi of power in congress and not on the basi of actual need bingo the higher up the government ladder the less actual need matter becaus polit power can be concentr at higher level while peopl with less cloud onli find themselv reduc to in effect in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pai off the other 49 state with pork defens contract agricultur subsidi etc or to be precis 30 of the state sinc you need 60 to beat the filibust then why not simpli leav new york s educ to new york i remain unconcinv that there is ani state in the union which is not capabl of educ it own children if that s what thei want to do and if you leav it to them you onli have to worri about the pork in that state and sinc industri can t concentr their polit power and wealth rather thei must divid it among the state to try and get what thei want individu voic have more rel impact the problem with the fillibust is not that you must bui off state but that the congress ha acquir too much power to sell pork it is not a case of the system of govern thei creat fail but that it is oper under a set of condit thei specif want to avoid name a concentr of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduc the power of either hous in some attempt to greas the wheel all you ll get then is a system which move quicker to do stupid thing it would make more sens to make more decis at a local level no you have to break the machin free of seizur befor you can redirect it but why on earth should we want to redirect it you said yourself that you have to sell pork to get thing through congress if congr ha less author to sell pork and retain it author to enact nation legisl within it grant jurisdict the pork problem is significantli reduc the current block on power simpli absolv congress of ani respons to come to a decis the current block essenti state that inact is prefer to action thu it the system is weight against action consid the govern the usual the institut with the sole power to enforc it decis by forc i consid bia against make those decis a good thing push the decis lower in the pyramid won t work unless the lower level ar less corrupt in most case thei ar wors not better the differ with the lower pyramid is that a thei have more legal legitim author in most matter under our constitut than the feder govern and b at those lower level power is harder to concentr and c you get the benefit of not impos new deicison on everybodi at onc you get to see them tri out without a nation decis congression action usual treat the entir countri as a whole yet even with similar problem in differ area differ solut mai be call for and while i often don t agre with the decis my local and state rep make at least i have a better option of go to the citi council and shoot my mouth off i d much rather the major of law be made by access peopl who hang around and end up have to put up with them rather than somebodi far off in washington with half a million or more constitu i m curiou what you base your assumpt that lower level ar more corrupt i fail to see where ani restrict impli or otherwis were place on the veto it could just as easili have been read as a mean to put a check on democrat popular but unwis in the execut s opinion polici sinc we were argu from the federalist paper i would point to them phill you brought up the federalist paper we were argu the fillibust and whether or not a minor of senat should be allow to hold up a bill you claim the senat wa suppos to be a far less power hous and i contend there wa noth in the constitut or other write which indic thi which wa when you brought up that we can t decid what the founder want base on the federalist paper you argu against them i never argu from them i have primarili refer to the constitut which place onli veri small restrict on the senat than for the hous the us constitut give almost no reason as to how it should work the onli part where a reason is given is the right to bear arm ammend where the well regul militia justif is ambigu the u s constitut is a nut and bolt document the delcar of independ wa the high brow reason there ar a coupl of other exampl though such as the reason for the power to tax and the reason for the power to grant permit both in articl i section 8 that the veto wa meant to be an except measur follow from the fact of the senat if the presid wa meant to revis legisl then there would be three chamber of the legislatur not two furthermor the separ of power would have been much less distinct to a certain extend i do believ the veto ha becom someth it wasn t intend howev i also believ it is inevit consid the congress own abus of their power to make bill sai whatev thei want them to sai unlik most peopl i think we shouldn t be worri about the veto which is fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessit it abus there is no limit in the constitut to the presid s veto power regard what a bill is for previou presid have us the veto for ani number of reason most usual have someth to do with their agenda i am realli curiou how you singl bush out as the presid who abus veto he ha the record for veto bush phill that s absurd bush had 37 veto on of which wa over ridden go read up on fdr if you think that s anyth resembl a record why is it not a reason restrict becaus 51 senat is the magic holi number upon which law must be base if 41 senat feel safe enough with their state constitu to stand up and fillibust isn t that enough to indic there s a suffici question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re evalu it up to a point the fact is though that when the major ar oppos by a minor the minor should not be allow to win by default why not what is inher wrong with bias the system against action histor governemnt action in the u s when deal with issu with a bare minor and a larg minor have not been success when you re in a posit of impos feder power on divers peopl why should the feder govern not have to got through someth more than a bare major why on earth should 51% be suffici to enact a law which cover 250 million peopl in veri veri divers place and live in radic differ condit why shouldn t a super major be requir becaus the bill at issu is a monei bill relat to a short term propos now we re switch from a gener question of a fillibust to a specif bill i don t see how it make a differ it is not a chang in the law where a presupposit in favour of the statu quo is arguabl sure it s arguabl theyr e argu it howev requir 60% to bring it to a vote ensur that thei ll have to have a good argument someth that isn t base sole on parti line ani system in which the simpl major is given absolut power to ignor the minor then the minor will be ignor i do not see thi as a posit thing and for all that i m sure the republican ar look for pork as much as the democrat thei ve got some legitim object to the legisl in question so instead you consid a system under which the minor automat win to be superior no i am complet happi with a system which requir a minor for action sinc u s histori is a histori of carv up popul group and implement piec meal on minor i feel minor should have suffic clout to prevent action thei feel strongli enough about and 41% is hardli a tini minor i don t advoc the minor be capabl of initi actionm but i see no problem with bias the feder system against action david veal univ of tenn div of cont educ info servic group pa146008 utkvm1 utk edu i still rememb the wai you laugh the dai your push me down the
