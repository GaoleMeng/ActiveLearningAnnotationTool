in articl apr 20 03 03 06 1993 3836 geneva rutger edu shellgat llo uu4 psi com larri l overack write you ask where we ar i would echo that question i m not try to be contenti but assum that the pope ha univers jurisdict and author what author do you reli upon for your decis what prevent me from choos ani doctrin i like and sai that papal disagr is an error that will be resolv in time thi is especi true sinc council of bishop have basic stood by the pope the ultim question is the tradit theologi of the church thi is the onli thing that it is possibl to resist a pope for hi departur from the tradit doctrin of the church if command from ani author conflict with tradit the command must be disobei my own view on thi is that thi conflict could onli happen in a major wai god would never allow a hair split situat to develop it would be too complex for peopl to figur out i don t view the present situat in the church as anyth extrem complic run through a list of what ha happen in the last 30 year in the cathol church and ani imparti observ will be aghast it appear that much of what li at the heart of thi matter is disagr over what is tradit and tradit and also over author and disciplin the problem stem from a gener widespread ignor of the cathol faith in my opinion most cathol know about zilch about the cathol faith thi leav them wide open for destruct by er bishop it s basic the reform part ii there is not even a question in my mind that in some respect the shard of the cathol church ar current be trampl upon by the cathol hierarchi i could go on list shock thing for an hour probabl take the situat in campo brazil for exampl i m read a book on what happen there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro mayer never introduc all the chang that follow in the wake of vatican ii he kept the tradit mass the same old catech etc he made sure the peopl knew their faith the cathol theologi of obedi what modern wa etc he innocul the peopl against what wa come well on dai the order came from rome for hi retir it came when the pope wa sick bishop de castro mayer wait until the pope recov then inquir whether thi command wa what the pope realli want or someth that some liber had command in hi absenc the pope confirm the decis so the good bishop retir the injustic that follow wa complet incred a new bishop wa instal he proceed to expel most of bishop de castro mayer s clergi from their church becaus thei refus to celebr the new mass the new bishop would visit a parish and celebr a new mass the peopl would promptli walk out of the church en mass the bishop wa enrag by thi he usual resort to enlist the help of the secular author to eject the priest from the church the priest would just start build new church the peopl were complet behind them the old parish had the new mass as the bishop desir and virtual no parishion the prime motiv for all thi wa complet illeg accord to canon law no priest can be penal in ani wai for sai the tradit mass becaus of legisl enact by pope saint piu v nor is there ani oblig to sai the new mass dure all thi process the peopl of campo not just privat individu but includ civil author were constantli send petit and letter to rome to do someth about the new modernist bishop noth wa ever done no help ever arriv from rome eventu 37 priest were kick out and about 40 000 peopl my question to the support of sspx is thi is there ani wai that your posit with respect to church reform could chang and be conform to those of the pope assum that the pope s posit doe not chang and that the leader of sspx don t jointli make such choic if not thi appear to be claim infal teach author if i adopt the view that i m not wrong i can t be wrong and there s no wai i ll chang my mind you must chang your that i ve either left the cathol church or it ha left me if the pope defin certain thing ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversi that process is all veri well understood in cathol theologi and anyon who doesn t go along with it is an instant non cathol the problem here is that peopl do not appreci what is go on in the cathol world if thei knew the faith and what our bishop ar do thei would be shock we sould argu from now until the second come about what the real tradit teach of the church is if thi were a simpl matter east and west would not have been separ for over 900 year thi isn t the case in the cathol church there is a massiv bodi of tradit teach the pope of the last 150 year ar especi relev there is no question at all what the tradit doctrin is i thought that the teach magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teach regard faith and moral even in the short term i mai be wrong here i m not roman cathol that s heresi more or less although thei have done a great job sinc the reform the last 30 year have seen so mani error spread that it s piti infal rest in the pope and in the church as a whole in the short term a pope or larg section of the church can go astrai in fact that s what usual happen dure a major heresi larg section of the church go astrai the pope histor ha been much more reliabl everyth will alwai come back in the long run what would be the effect of a pope make an ex cathedra statement regard the sspx situat would it be honor if not how do you get around the formal doctrin of infal again i m not try to be content i m try to understand sinc i m orthodox i ve got no real vest interest in the outcom on wai or the other ye it would be honor infal is infal but what is he go to defin that the new mass is a better express of the cathol faith than the old that sex educ in the cathol school is wonder that all religion ar wonder except for that profess by the pope prior to vatican ii it doe if the command wa legitim sspx doe not view the pope s command as legitim why thi is a veri slipperi slope not realli start studi the major cathol theologian of the last 300 year everyth is veri well spell out the west excel at critic thought rememb that s what cathol theologian have been busi at for centuri
