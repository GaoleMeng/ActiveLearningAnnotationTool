in articl mai 11 05 06 28 1993 5458 geneva rutger edu hedrick geneva rutger edu write thi came from here s hi respons kinsei see below is the sourc of the figur 10 percent there wa an articl in usa todai a few month ago show the result of a studi that actual onli about 1% were homosexu i saw anoth figur that list 2% as the figur of cours even if it were 99% that would have littl bear on whether or not it is a sin behavior how mani peopl have commit other act of fornic how mani peopl have li or sin in other wai but in all fair the shameless natur of their act is a reflect of the gener spiritu state of the peopl and not a specif featur of homosexu why isn t it a specif featur of homosexu paul describ men with men work that which is unseemli to describ the act sure there spirtual natur wa deprav also and like the other sin the idolatri the other sexual immora and the other sin sprang from their deprav spiritu state which wa a result of man s not glorifi god as god and be thank still their act were shameless homosexu or even consid it accept in some case on the other hand none of these passag contain explicit teach on the subject rom 1 is realli about idolatri it refer to homosexu in pass is everyth sin specif elabor on in the new testament scriptur doe not condemn be a drug dealer be rule by the spirit rather than the letter not onli free from legal it also protect us from sin that ar against the spirit the word is a two edg sword that cut both wai i think we must be care befor we total throw out leviticu if the law is reflect of god s charact and true holi natur then those who sai that god endors homosexu run into a problem if homosexu were natur whatev that mean wholesom endors by god and those who oppos sexual behavior ar narrow mind biggot as some would have us believ why is there a condemn of it in leviticu thi condemn is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemn and there is noth in the text to sai that thi law wa limit to templ prostitut and no good reason to believ that thi wa the case furthermor male homosexu sex wa a death penalti crime is everi sin elabor on in the new testament take a look at i corinthian 5 paul said that on of the corinthian had broken a law not even heard of among the gentil that on should have hi father s wife there is a prohibit against have your father s wife in leviticu no other new testament vers clearli condemn it besid thi on notic that paul did not sai that the sin wa in commit adulteri etc he spoke against have on s father s wife notic also that thi sexual condemn in leviticu is not mention in the specif context of pagan either and there wa no pagan coustom mention in i corinthian either as a matter of fact take on s father s wife wasn t even done among the gentil it wa just a plain blantant sin whether worship idol wa involv or not on commonli made claim is that paul had simpli never face the kind of question we ar try to deal with he encount homosexu onli in context where most peopl would probabl agre that it wa wrong he had never face the experi of christian who try to act straight and fail and he had never face christian who ar try to defin a christian homosexu which fit with gener christian ideal of fidel and of see sexual as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexu among idolat and us it to make judgement on these question on of the reason that some of us do not accept that common argument is becaus paul probabl did face thi and other problem sin can be tough to over come especi without supernatur power is homosexu sin ani more difficult to overcom that heterosexu sin like lust after a marri woman or sleep around with peopl of the opposit sex i doubt it and even if it is that is no excus god is greater than all of it anoth reason we reject it is becaus it ignor the supernatur power of god to interven in thi kind of situat how mani peopl have been set free from sin by the power of god sure there mai be ani group that have tri to chang homosexu and fail that is a reflect on the peopl involv in the program and not god s willing and abil to chang a sinner ani program that us formula mai fail what peopl need is the power of god to chang them whether thei ar involv in homosexu sin or ani other sin i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexu christian is not entir a theolog issu but also a pastor on paul s tendenc as we can see in issu such as eat meat and celebr holidai is to be uncompromis on principl but in pastor issu to look veri carefulli at the good of the peopl involv and to avoid insist on perfect when it would be person damag for exampl while paul clearli believ that it wa accept to eat meat he want us to avoid push peopl into do an action about which thei had person qualm i don t see how you come to that conclus paul s deal with pastori issu encourag peopl to give up their liberti in order to spare other not to allow peopl to continu in sin becaus it wa just too difficult take the exampl of eat meat offer to idol paul felt that there wa noth wrong in an abstract sens with eat the meat yet he advis believ to sacrific their liberti to eat meat in order to spare other but paul never allow peopl to sin becaus live holi wa just to tough paul wrote to make no provis for the flesh to fulfil the lust thereof roman 13 14 then he goe in to a discours on how we should sacrific our own liberti in order to spare the conscienc of other suppos it were not a sin for peopl to practic homosexu act sinc other consid it to be a sin then us paul s approach on pastori issu those who would otherwis be homosexu should sacrific their liberti and be celbat or monogam marri to a member of the opposit sex paul never offer a lesser sin homosexu marriag to prevent peopl from engag in what mai be consid a more damag sin for anoth exampl paul obvious would have prefer to see peopl at least in some circumst remain unmarri yet if thei were unabl to do so he certainli would rather see them marri than in a state where thei might be tempt to fornic yet marriag itself is not a sin marriag is holi in all and someth that god ordain and paul recogn thi note that in the creation stori work enter human life as a result of sin thi doesn t mean that christian can stop work when we ar save actual adam wa put in the garden to tend to it befor he fell after he fell he would have to toil over the ground the danger of try to cure it ar that the attempt most often fail and when it doe you end up with damag rang from psycholog damag to suicid as well as broken marriag when attempt at live as a heterosexu fail that is why we ar depend total on god what a vuner and gloriou posit to be it we all must be transform by the renew of our mind and that is the onli wai homosexu can walk in freedom just like anyon els but i can well imagin paul prefer to see peopl in long term commit christian relationship than promiscu as with work which genesi suggest wasn t part of god s origin ideal either i think such relationship can still be a vehicl for peopl share god s love with each other i m sure you can see how peopl with the oppos view see thi conclus it s like sai how should i kill myself with gun or aresen what about the person who just is overcom with a desir to sleep with goat would it be better for him to sleep with on goat or all of them what about the person who want to sleep with hi aunt would it be better for him to sleep with on aunt or all of them in all these case the more peopl or anim on sleep with the higher the chanc that thei will get a diseas but thi onli deal with physic aspect of the question whichev sin is commit it all lead to spiritu death cent action ar the same when christian homosexu sai that their relationship ar differ than the greek homosexu that paul would have been familiar with thi is exactli the same kind of argument that is be made about judici oath and tax collector the issu that is most often address in scriptur seem to be the actual act second isn t it histor snobberi to sai that onli homosexu of thi centuri ar capabl of have love relationship there ar ancient write glorifi homosexu love btw i am on who believ in refrain from make oath also where do you get that tax collector ar sinner that s certainli not explicit jesu didn t tell zachia to quit hi job link hudson i m reluct to comment in thi in detail our basic concept of the intent of jesu and paul ar greatli differ as i indic in the articl whatev the ambigu of variou word and i still think thei ar signific it doe seem clear that paul consid the homosexu he saw around him wrong what you do with thi fact depend upon your basic approach to the bibl i m afraid that commun between legalist and anti legalist christian is even harder than between protest and cathol in the 16th cent sinc you disagre with my start point obvious you re go to disagre with all of the intermedi discuss and conclus sometim discuss is still us i ve seen some veri interest work on paul done by jew obvious thei don t agre with him but thei sometim have help insight into what he meant but i don t see much sign for hope here in talk religion misc there s an axiom that by the time hitler s name is invok all hope for sensibl discuss is gone on thi subject when sleep with goat is invok i don t think there s enough basi for understand to be worth pursu
