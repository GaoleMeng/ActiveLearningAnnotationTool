i would like the opinion of netter on a subject that ha been bother my wife and me late liturgi in particular cathol liturgi in the last few year it seem that there ar more and more ad hoc event dure mass it s drive me crazi the most grace fill aspect of a liturg tradit is that what happen is someth we _all_ do togeth becaus we all know how to do it led by the priest of cours which make it a kind of dialogu we present to god but the best mass i ve been to were participatori prayer late i think the proport of particip ha fallen and the proport of sit there and watch or listen or gener be told what to do which is necessari becaus no on know what s happen next is grow exampl last sundai palm sundai we went to the local church usual on palm sundai the congreg particip in read the passion take the role of the mob the theologi behind thi seem profound when we sai crucifi him we mean it we did it and if he came back todai we d do it again it alwai give me chill but last week we were invit to sit dure the gospel passion and _listen_ besid the orwellian invit i wa realli sadden to have my and our littl role taken awai thi seem typic of a shift of particip awai from the peopl and toward the musician reader and so on new thing ar introduc in the cours of the liturgi and sinc no on know what s happen the new thing have to be explain and pretti soon instead of _do_ a lot of the mass we re just sit there listen or space out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind i lai the blame on liturgi committe made up of lai expert but that mai not be just i do think that a liturgi committe ha a bia toward do someth rather than noth that s just a fact of bureaucrat life even though a simpler liturgi mai in fact make it easier for peopl to be awar of the lord s presenc so we ve been wonder ar we the oddbal or is the qualiti of the mass go down i don t mean that faceti we go to mass everi thursdai or fridai and ar remind of the power of a veri simpl liturgi to make us awar of god s presenc but as far as the obligatori sundai mass mayb i should just offer it up ha anyon els notic declin congreg particip in cathol mass late john murrai
