and the isra like to view the villag thei ar small commun with kid plai soccer in the street women prepar lunch men plai card etc some young men usual ag between 17 to 30 year ar member of the lebanes resist even the inhabit of the villag do not know who these ar thei ar secret about it but most peopl often suspect who thei ar and what thei ar up to these young men ar support financi by iran most of the time thei sneak arm and ammunit into the occupi zone where thei set up boobi trap for isra patrol everi time an isra soldier is kill or injur by these trap israel retalli by indiscrimin bomb villag of their own choos often kill onli innoc civilian thi a tri and true method util by guerilla and terrorist group to conduct oper in the midst of the local populac thu forc the oppos state to possibl harm innoc civilian in their search or in order to avoid the death of civilian abandon the search certainli the peopl who us the popul for cover ar also to blaim for drag the innoc civilian into harm s wai ar you suggest that when guerilla us the popul for cover israel should total back down so the easiest wai to get awai with attack anoth is to us an innoc as a shield and hope that the other respect innoc live tell me tim what ar these guerilla do wrong assum that thei ar us civilian for cover ar thei not kill soldier in their countri if the buffer zone is to prevent attack on israel is it not work why is it further neccessari for isra gun to pound lebanes villag why not just kill those who try to infiltr the buffer zone you see there is more to the shell of the villag it is call retali get back get even it doesn t make sens to shell the villag the least it show is a reckless disregard by the isra govern for the live of civilian if israel insist that the so call secur zone is necessari for the protect of northern israel than it will have to pai the price of it occup with the blood of it soldier if israel is interest in peac than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will onli occur when arab state show that thei ar prepar to take on the respons and the duti to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil thei have to prove it or provid some guarate there is no wai israel is go to accept their word not with their past attitud of toler toward anti israel guerilla in resid if israel is not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busi wast other time come to the peac talk i have written befor on thi veri newsgroup that the onli real solut will come as a result of a comprehens peac settlement wherebi israel withdraw to it own border and peac keep troop ar station along the border to insur no on on either side of the border is shell good lord brad no i am not basil i think basil is a veri intellig person and i respect what he write basil is a person that i would gladli call a friend he is howev not me nor am i lebanes as some seem to suspect thi is the onli realist solut it is time for israel to realiz that the concept of a buffer zone aim at protect it northern citi ha fail in fact it ha caus much more isra death than the occasion shell of northern israel would have result in perhap you ar awar that to most commun of peopl there is the feel that it is better that mani of us die fight against those who attack us than for few to die while we silent accept our fate if howev you call on israel to see the sens of suffer fewer casualti i suggest you appli the same to palestinian arab and islam group tim you ar ignor the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have been disarm hezbollah remain the onli independ militia hezbollah doe not attack israel except at a few time such as when the idf burn up sheikh mosavi hi wife and young son of cours if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassin peopl and shell villag thei wouldn t make the lebanes so mad as to do that furthermor with hezbollah subsequ disarm it would not be possibl and now the lebanes govern ha proven that it is capabl of control and disarm all militia as thei did in all other part of lebanon basil it ha not without the support and activ involv of syria lebanon would not have been abl to accomplish all that ha occur onc syria leav who is to sai that lebanon will be abl to retain control if syria stai thai mai be even more danger for israel tim when is the last time that you recal ani troubl on the syrian border not late eh israel know veri well that the syrian ar abl to restrain all who would us territori under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be better off with syria and israel out of it border the presenc of syrian troop in lebanon ha meant a sharp decreas in attack on isra territori not on isra troop in lebanon howev pleas note the distinct in the past two year tim your view of thi entir matter is far too seren on side and select naiv i disagre basil ha alwai seem to me to be a cool head person slow to anger certainli more so than i what is most import is that he is an actual wit to thing from the other end of the isra gun if onli the isra govern would rememb what it wa like when the role were revers perhap thei would moder their retali brad hernlem hernlem chess ncsu edu
