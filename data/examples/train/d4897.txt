i m work on a system which us a given set of 3d kei frame posit x y z to control an imaginari camera movement i m us kochanek bartel spline as describ in the siggraph 84 proceed to creat a variabl number of inbetween between the kei frame i want the inbetween to be given in the form x y z dx dy dz where the last three argumentsa ar the x y and z compon of the view direct vector of the camera when posit at x y z the method present by kochanek and bartel onli deal with the posit of the inbetween view point to be gener i ve tri to set the view direct at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjac view point which in gener ar not kei frame but thi caus a sligt discontinu of the view direct vector at the kei frame posit although the spatial movement seem to work fine and i m quit certain i think that i ve not simpli made an implement error now i wonder if anyon out there ha us thi spline form for similar purpos and how thei decid the view vector i d appreci repli to be email to me at iharkest lise unit no anyon els interest in the answer will be sent a summari of the repli if thei contact me _________ __________________ n g e a r k e s t a d iharkest lise unit no comp sc ________ _______________ nth norwegian institut of technolog some peopl plai hard to get i plai hard to want ford fairlan
