limbaugh remind you of anyon daevid bornhuett machen the madison edg the main differ between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh is that hitler wa origin and show initi mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show abc radio network octob 27 1992 nln believ it or not i wa plan thi compar review of mein kampf and limbaugh s transcrib rant the wai thing ought to be befor sahl issu hi compar review as usual sahl s wa independ and sharp as a scalpel my effort can onli dream of compar favor to mort s at least it ha a fairli popular orgin premis everyon i d mention the idea to thought it wa either divin inspir or at least past due for deliveri those reaction ar base on parallel that should be obviou to the most peripher observ of the act of those fals prophet both ar note for their galvan orator skill which thei both us with passion to gener a polit cult of massiv numer proport in fact limbaugh claim to have an audienc of just over 12 million almost ident to the number of vote cast for hitler in the april 1932 german elect both us a myopic social perspect to build the cult and enthusiast amput fact from the record to fabric their ideolog quilt the last point is glaringli document by passag in the open page of both book hitler s exampl is when on page 5 he claim the german nationalist terrorist leo schlaget he bomb part of a railwai line between dusseldorf and duisburg be caught in the act in 1923 wa betrai to franc by a repres of hi govern when there ha never been ani factual foundat for such a statement in fact the govern of both the reich and prussia as well as the vatican activ interven to save him from execut and almost succeed limbaugh follow suit by make the hyster sarcast claim in hi introduct that in a school or dure a commenc ceremoni or mani other public place god is unconstitut of cours it s not god but the offici imposit of particular concept of god against an individu s will that s unconstitut but limbaugh is too gleeful in hi talent for distort to want you to know that of cours on would assum that by compar the two book my main point would be that the wai thing ought to be is the modern american mein kampf not realli at the time of the first german version of mein kampf hitler wa just four month out of prison june 1925 and try to reorgan the nazi he us the book to build hi dozen million follow limbaugh on the other hand came up with hi book after build hi dozen million twelv million went a longer wai in weimar germani that it doe in the republicrat unit state thu the more accur parallel would be that limbaugh s daili three hour radio show is the american mein kampf the primari propoganda tool us to pump up the angri volum and that the wai thing ought to be is actual the american triumph of the will a translat of the same fascist messag into a differ medium also the print word wa the more import medium in weimar germani sinc radio wa still be thought of by impoverish german as a medium of luxuri in 1925 todai on the other hand american ar more like to spend a few second to tune a radio dial at no monetari charg than drop $22 for 304 page of transcript of the same word but as mort sahl also observ on the radio the other night some cloutmeist of the radic right want limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda and rememb sahl is an al haig conserv these dai mort might not know exactli who rush s equival of rodolf hess is the book itself suggest ed mclaughlin the former presid of abc radio and now limbaugh s partner in efm media the radio program s product compani but mort himself is a veteran of the talk show have host them in new york washington and lo angel he know what evil lurk in the heart of major market media men he know that limbaugh could not have collect hi audienc had not the opportun been place on a silver platter and hand to him limbaugh earn hi monei just as honestli as al capon did it s almost worthi of a rico indict on question of social issu there is an overabund of materi in the limbaugh
