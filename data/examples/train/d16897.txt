servic uci edu tclock orion oac uci edu tim clock write ar you suggest that when guerilla us the popul for cover israel should total back down so the easiest wai to get awai with attack anoth is to us an innoc as a shield and hope that the other respect innoc live tell me tim what ar these guerilla do wrong assum that thei ar us civilian for cover assum also come on brad if we ar go to get anywher in thi or ani discuss it doesn t help to bring up element i never address nor comment on in ani wai i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong onli that civilian ar be us as cover and that have been place in between the isra and the guerilla thei will be injur as both parti continu their fight pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possibl for the idf to fail to detect the presenc of those respons for plant the bomb which kill the three idf troop and then later know the exact number and whereabout of all of them sever villag were shell how could the idf possibl have known that there were guerrilla in each of the target villag you see it wa an arbitrari act of retali if the buffer zone is to prevent attack on israel is it not work why is it further neccessari for isra gun to pound lebanes villag why not just kill those who try to infiltr the buffer zone you see there is more to the shell of the villag it is call retali get back get even it doesn t make sens to shell the villag the least it show is a reckless disregard by the isra govern for the live of civilian i agre with you here i have alwai thought that israel s bomb sorte and bomb polici is stupid thoughtless inhuman and ineffect but there is no reason that israel should passiv wait until attack chose to act there is everi reason to believ that take the fight to the enemi will do more to stop attack as i said previous israel spent sever decad sit passiv on it side of a border and onli act to stop these attack after the attack had enter isra territori it didn t work veri well the host arab state did littl noth to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel so the number of attack were consider higher as wa their physic and psycholog impact on the civilian caught in their path the problem tim is that the origin reason for the invas wa palestinian attack on israel not lebanes attack what so the whole bit about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will onli occur when arab state show that thei ar prepar to take on the respons and the duti to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil thei have to prove it or provid some guarate there is no wai israel is go to accept their word not with their past attitud of toler toward anti israel guerilla in resid if israel is not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busi wast other time come to the peac talk thi is just anoth select appli statement the reason for thi drawn out impass between abab palestinian and isra is that neither side is will to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyon should stai awai from the negoti that is precis why the palestinian in their recent pisga propos for the interim period after negoti and lead up to full autonomi ar demand condit that essenti defin autonomi alreadi thei do not trust that israel will follow through the entir process and allow palestinian to reach full autonomi do you understand and accept thi viewpoint by the palestinian if you do then why should israel s view of arab palestinian be ani differ why should thei trust the arab palestinian word sinc thei don t thei ar veri reluct to give up tangibl asset land control of area in exchang for word for thi reason thei ar also concern about the sort of guarante thei will have that the arab will follow through on their part of ani agreement reach first i believ that my statement appli to both side have said that i think it is neccessari to separ what is legitim negoti and what is not for exampl no countri ha the right to abus on s human right decid whether there will be on or two state in palestin is a legitim question while de facto on state exist israel must treat all within it domain equit tim you ar ignor the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have been disarm hezbollah remain the onli independ militia hezbollah doe not attack israel except at a few time such as when the idf burn up sheikh mosavi hi wife and young son while the major armament those allow peopl to wage civil war have been remov the weapon need to cross border attack still remain to some extent rocket attack still continu and commando raid onli requir a few easili conceal weapon and a refin disregard for human life your of that of other such attack also continu ye i am afraid that what you sai is true but that still doe not justifi occupi your neighbor s land israel must resolv it disput with the nativ palestinian if it want peac from such attack of cours if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassin peopl and shell villag thei wouldn t make the lebanes so mad as to do that bat guano the situat you call for exist in the 1970s and attack were commonplac not true lebanes were not attack israel in the 1970s with a strong lebanes govern free from syrian and isra interfer i believ that the border could be adequ patrol the palestinian heavi weapon have been siez in past year and i do not see as signific a threat as onc exist pleas tim don t fall into the trap of treat lebanes and palestinian as all part of the same group there ar too mani who think all arab or all muslim ar the same too mani time i have seen peopl support the bomb of palestinian camp in retali for an idf death at the hand of the lebanes resist or the shell of lebanes villag in retali for a palestinian attack tim
