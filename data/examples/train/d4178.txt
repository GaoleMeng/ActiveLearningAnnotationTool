paid to you by a your big heart alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm let s suppos that thi is a true dichotomi so p a p b 1 troubl is alteriu is in a differ univers so that no observ of alteriu ar possibl except for the bank you couldn t possibl afford it now let s examin the case for a there is no evid whatsoev that there is ani such thing as a big heart alterian benefactor howev p exist b h a b p not exist b h a b 1 on the ground that lack_of_evid_for is evid_against when we have a partit like that we dismiss hypothesi a turn therefor to b we also find no evid to support that hypothesi on the same ground as befor we dismiss hypothesi b the problem with thi is that we have dismiss all of the possibl hypothes and even though we know by construct that the monei arriv everi month we have proven that it can t becaus we have dismiss all of it potenti caus that s an extrem poor argument and here s why premis 1 thi monei is be paid to you by either a your big heart alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm thu each monthli appear of the buck should it happen is an observ on alteriu and by construct is evid for the exist of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm premis 2 no observ on alteriu ar possibl except for the bank you couldn t possibl afford it you forgot to includ thi my premis is actual premis 2 the cardin of the set of possibl observ on alteriu is on thi is clearli contradictori to the first not if you state it properli troubl is on the basi of premis 2 you sai that there can be no evid of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premis lead to the conclus that the appear of the buck should it happen is evid for the exist of either the benefactor or the bug voila a scream contradict with my highlight sc but in a strawman argument there is onli evid for oneof benefactor bug no observ to distinguish benefactor from bug is possibl that is not evid for bug and neither is it evid for benefactor nor is true to sai that thi hypothet univers appear exactli as if there were no benefactor bug two statement both would be fals thi is still contradictori it reduc to 1 alterian dosh arriv in my account is due to benefactor or bug 2 thi is not evid for benefactor neither is it evid for bug mean that it doesn t lend more weight to on than to the other 3 therefor no evid can exist for benefactor and no evid can exist for bug but 3 reli on a shift in mean from 2 when you sai paraphras in 2 that thi is not evid for benefactor for exampl what you mean is that it s no more evid for benefactor than it is for bug ye that s what i mean in 3 howev you ve shift the mean of evid for benefactor so that it now mean absolut evid for benefactor rather than rel evid for benefactor w r t bug not realli i meant evid that would tend to on over the other i think thi is just a commun problem what i am try to sai in my clumsi wai is that while i bui your theori as far as it relat to theism make predict prayer your raptur exampl i don t bui your us of occam s razor in all case where a 0 in my exampl on couldn t dismiss benefactor or bug on the ground of simplic on of these is necessari to explain the dosh i brought up the on by on dismiss process to show that it would be wrong to do so from what you re sai in thi post it seem you agre and we re talk at cross purpos 3 is still in contradict to 1 some sum mai help with b benefactor b bug d dosh arriv in account 1 impli p b b d 1 assum that p bb d 0 so it s either the benefactor or a bug which is respons if the buck arriv but not both then p b b d p b d p b d so p b d p b d 1 but 3 impli that p b d 0 and p b d 0 no thi isn t what i meant p b d 0 5 and p b d 0 5 with necessarili no new observ we ve alreadi seen the dosh to chang those estim i wa try to sai again in my clumsi wai that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probabl to either of these and that s precis what us of the razor doe in the case of god god ar on class of hypothesi there ar mani other belong to a set of hypothes _on_of_which_ is necessari to explain someth which otherwis would _not_ be satisfactorili explain it can be thrown out or retain on ground of non ration prefer not of scienc or statist altern on could chuck out or retain the lot on the ground that the answer can t be known or that the notion probabl estim ar effect useless be equal agnostic weak atheism as thei do when the set m is fill by the univers is caus by x where x is god pink unicorn noth etc and no observ tend to on conclus over the other exactli the point i wa make i think so we don t throw out ani of these contrari to your assert abov that we do some peopl do simon and thei think thei ar do excel scienc my sole point wa that thei aren t onli observ which directli contradict the hypothesi h i i e x where p x h i 0 can caus p h i to go to zero after a finit number of observ onli in thi case do we get to throw ani of the hypothes out exactli my point though i mai have been unclear you said the diametr opposit which i guess is the sourc of my confus i wa mere try to illustr the incorrect of do so what i m try to sai is that while you ar correct to sai that absenc of evid can sometim be evid of absenc thi doe not hold true for all or perhap ani version of theism and it isn t true that those for which it doe not hold can be discard us the razor on the contrari those for which it doe not hold ar exactli those which can be discard us the razor see my post on the other branch of thi thread then you seem to be guilti of the contradict you accus me of if the razor hold for god then it hold for all like hypothes which mean that you re assign p x h i 0 for all i though we ve alreadi establish that it s not correct to do so when sum p x h i 1 over all i simpli put anyon who claim to have a viabl proof of the exist or non exist of god whether induct or no is at best mistaken and at worst bark mad luckili i make no such claim and have specif said as much on numer occas you wouldn t be construct a strawman here would you frank although that doesn t of cours rule out my be bark mad in ani case i could be bark mad in my spare time with apolog to clees et al but i think you miss the point onc again when i sai that someth is evid against an hypothesi that doesn t impli that observ of the said someth necessarili falsifi the hypothesi reduc the estim of p h data to zero if it reduc thi quantiti it s still evid against h no i got that i m talk about the case when a 0 you re clearli correct when a 0 and i m not construct a strawman though it s certainli possibl that i ve misunderstood what you re sai howev by ani standard a system that sai when a 0 god ar highli unlik and when a 0 god can be dismiss us the razor is a system purport to be an induct proof that god either don t exist or ar unnecessari to explain ani or all phenomena in my experi system such as thi includ those which purport to prove that god exist alwai contain a fallaci upon close examin if that s not what you re sai then pleas put me straight frank o dwyer i m not hatch that odwyer sse ie from hen by evelyn conlon
