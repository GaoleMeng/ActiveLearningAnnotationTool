procedur note ted direct followup to misc legal onli while i respect hi right to do so my own opinion ar that 1 followup to field ar mere suggest not mandatori command and 2 thi issu is of suffici a gener polit relev and b civil liberti interest to warrant keep it activ in t p m and a s c l as well at least for thi round in articl 1993apr11 155955 23346 midwai uchicago edu thf2 midwai uchicago edu said uh no that s not what happen in _boomer_ what happen in _boomer_ wa that the judg didn t allow the plaintiff to blackmail the cement plant by demand a multi million dollar plant to be shut down over $185 000 in damag and requir the plant to pai the plaintiff the $185 000 to make them whole the plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff s lawyer would have just negoti a windfal settlement becaus the plaintiff would prefer an amount greater than $185k to have the plant shut down while the plant would prefer ani amount less than the valu of the plant to have the plant continu in oper everyon s properti right were protect the plaintiff were made whole unnecessari settlement cost were avoid okai now here s my interpret of _boomer_ base on the fact as present in the new york court of appeal hold _boomer v note the new york court of appeal is the highest court in new york state while the unit state and 48 of the fifti state call their highest court suprem court suprem judici court or suprem court of appeal maryland and new york call their simpli the court of appeal to make matter wors new york also call it _second highest_ court the suprem court appel divis atlant cement co _ 26 n y 2d 219 257 n e 2d 870 1970 oscar h boomer et al own land near the atlant cement compani s plant near albani n y the fact pattern give no inform as to which came first the plaintiff s acquisit of the land or he defend s start of product at their cement plant in the cours of it regular oper the cement plant did injuri to the plaintiff properti via dirt smoke and vibrat eman from the plant the plaintiff sought injunct relief that is thei ask the court to order atlant cement to stop damag their properti commentari thi seem entir reason to me boomer at al own their properti and presum a right to quiet enjoy of it atlant cement s action were depriv boomer et al of that right instead of grant the plaintiff request for an injunct the court order them to accept the damag be done to their properti provid that atlant cement paid them $185 000 in compensatori damag in other word the court grant atlant cement co a privat parti the power and author to _take_ the plaintiff right to quiet enjoy of their properti by emin domain a take by emin domain is alwai problemat even when it s done by the state allow a privat firm to do it is in my opinion total wrong ye i know the _boomer_ court didn t call it emin domain but if it walk like emin domain and swim like emin domain and quack like emin domain let me take issu with the wai you ve present the case you sai that what happen in _boomer_ wa that the judg didn t allow the plaintiff to blackmail the cement plant by demand a multi million dollar plant to be shut down over $185 000 in damag blackmail pull out black s law dictionari abridg 5th edit blackmail unlaw demand of monei or properti under threat to do bodili harm to injur properti to accus of crime or to expos disgrac defect thi crime is commonli includ under extort statut how do you defin as blackmail on parti s act of demand the right to set it own sale price for a uniqu piec of properti which it own and which anoth parti ha express an interest in bui or of demand the right not to sell that properti at ani price as i see it boomer et al have found themselv in the fortun posit of own someth which atlant cement had to purchas if it want to stai in busi had everi right in the world to set whatev price thei want there isn t or at least shouldn t be ani law that sai that you have to be a nice gui in your privat busi deal you go on to sai the plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff s lawyer would have just negoti a windfal settlement becaus the plaintiff would prefer an amount greater than $185k to have the plant shut down while the plant would prefer ani amount less than the valu of the plant to have the plant continu in oper if so so what sinc when ar the court suppos to be in the busi of prevent parti from reap windfal settlement from other parti when those settlement aris from wrong act by those other parti if atlant cement didn t want to have to face a choic between pai a windfal settlement or go out of busi well shouldn t atlant cement have thought of that befor go _into_ busi i note that as far as the fact show boomer et al were _not_ the parti respons for bring about thi situat that wa atlant cement s own fault for choos to build and oper the type of plant thei did where and when thei did and then you sai everyon s properti right were protect the plaintiff were made whole unnecessari settlement cost were avoid as abov i disput your claim that the plaintiff were made whole thei were in fact by court action depriv of their right as owner of properti to choos to sell or not sell that properti at a price accept to them and for that depriv thei were _not_ made whole and again i ask sinc when ar the court suppos to be in the busi of ensur that unnecessari settlement cost ar avoid if so i ve been miseduc i alwai thought that the court were suppos to be in the busi of ensur that justic is done is _boomer_ realli be taught as infam that s realli sad if it is becaus i fail to see how it s less than complet sensibl you should read the law and econom stuff first hand instead of filter through teacher who clearli don t like it for whatev inexplic reason 1 _boomer_ is not be taught as infam at least not at my school asid northeastern law usual doe a veri good job of hire for their first year mandatori class such as tort where i first encount _boomer_ instructor who regardless of their person opinion can and do teach the law neutral when the student get into their second and third year in which the student a can pick and choos which cours to take except for the mandatori profession respons of cours and b ar presum to be a bit more worldli and self confid less like to be conscious or sub conscious intimid by law school professor and abl to learn from openli bias instructor rather than be indoctrin by them the instructor tend to be more open in express their own opinion thi is especi true of part time instructor who in real life ar practic attornei or sit judg thi can be _veri_ educ sometim far more so than be taught by a somewhat cloister scholar end of asid i call it infam becaus that s my opinion of it for the reason i ve state abov i believ it to be a triumph of someth that i can onli call econom correct over justic 2 it is complet sensibl onli if you believ that the alleg right of the owner of atlant cement to stai in busi and avoid lose a lot of their own monei due to their own wrong act and the alleg right of sever hundr atlant cement employe to not have their job disappear should trump the right of peopl who own properti which wa damag by atlant cement s wrong act and if you believ that it is correct for the court or ani other branch of govern to grant to privat parti the right to take other peopl s properti by emin domain you d like posner bill he s a libertarian realli i didn t know that what if anyth ha he had to sai about case like _boomer_ of cours he ha too much of a paper trail to ever be nomin by a presid democrat won t like hi antitrust stanc or republican won t like hi support of gai marriag and if bright law student shiver at what thei don t understand it s easi to imagin how the press will plai it up as babi sell i ve seen mike godwin claim that posner assert that law and econom is applic to everyth and is the end all and be all when posner sai precis the opposit so it goe i ve admit that my understand of the field gener refer to as law and econom is weak if it advoc the us of econom analysi as on of mani tie breaker factor which court mai us to help them reach decis in case in which the disput as measur by the scale of justic is evenli balanc fine but as illustr by _boomer_ it is _not_ fine when the court start view the econom of a case as be more import than the justic of a case william decemb starr wdstarr
