cont dr jame deyoung 3 r scrogg robin scrogg ha built upon the discuss of hi predecessor and suggest a new twist to the word scrogg believ that arsenokoitai is a hellenist jewish coinag perhap influenc by awar of rabbin terminolog the term is deriv from lev 18 22 20 13 where the lxx juxtapos the two word arseno male and koiten bed and repres the hebrew miskab zabar ly with a male yet he believ that paul did not origin the term but borrow it from circl of hellenist jew acquaint with rabbin discuss 180 n 14 it wa invent to avoid contact with the usual greek terminolog 108 if thi is true scrogg observ it explain why the word doe not appear in greco roman discuss of pederasti and why later patrist writer avoid it it wa meaningless to nativ speak greek 108 scrogg take the second part as the activ word and the first word as the object of the second part thu differ from boswel s learn discuss 107 yet scrogg understand the gener mean of on who li with a male to have a veri narrow refer with the preced malokoi i cor 6 9 which scrogg interpret as the effemin call boi arsenokoitai is the activ partner who keep the malako of the mistress or who hire him on occas to satisfi hi sexual desir 108 henc arsenokoitai doe not refer to homosexu in gener to femal homosexu or to the gener model of pederasti it certainli cannot refer to the modern gai model he affirm 109 thi is scrogg s interpret of the term in i tim 1 10 also the combin of pornoi fornic arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave dealer refer to male prostitut male who lie with them and slave dealer who procur them 120 it again refer to that specif form of pederasti which consist of the enslav of boi as youth for sexual purpos and the us of these boi by adult male 121 even seriou mind pagan author condemn thi form of pederasti he then us these instanc of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the appar gener condemn of both femal and male homosexu in rom 1 consequ paul must have had could onli have had pederasti in mind 122 we cannot know what paul would have said about the contemporari model of adult adult mutual in same sex relat ship 122 in relat these term to the context and to contemporari ethic concern scrogg emphas the point that the specif item in the list of vice in i cor 6 have no deliber intend mean in paul the form and function of the catalogu of vice ar tradit and stereotyp ani relationship between an individu item in the list and the context wa usual nonexist he conclud that paul doe not care about ani specif item in the list 104 both on the basi of the mean of the term and of the literari phenomenon of a catalogu of vice scrogg argu that the scriptur ar irrelev and provid no help in the heat debat todai 129 the model in todai s christian homosexu commun is so differ from the model attack by the nt that biblic judgment against homosexu ar not relev to todai s debat thei should no longer be us in denomin discuss about homosexu should in no wai be a weapon to justifi refus of ordin 127 reaction to the new interpret of arsenokoitai d wright in more recent year the posit of bailei boswel and scrogg have come under closer scrutini perhap the most critic evalu of boswel s view is that by david wright in hi thorough articl wright point out sever shortcom of boswel s treatment of arsenokoitai he fault boswel for fail to cite or cite inaccur all the refer to lev 18 22 and 20 13 in the church father such as eusebiu the apostol constitut clement of alexandria tertullian and origen 127 28 boswel ha not consid serious enough the possibl that the term deriv either it form or it mean from the leviticu passag 129 thi is signific for if the term is so deriv it clearli refut boswel s claim that the first half of the word arseno denot not the object but the gender of the second half koitai the lxx must mean a male who sleep with a male make arseno the object wright also fault boswel s claim regard linguist featur of the term includ suggest parallel 129 though boswel claim that compound with arseno emploi it object and those with arreno emploi it as an adject wright believ that the differ between the two is mere on of dialect divers no semant import attach to the differ between the two form 131 wright believ that in most compound in which the second half is a verb or ha a verbal forc the first half denot it object and where the second part is substantiv the first half denot it gender 132 it is with boswel s treatment of the earli church father that wright take special issu becaus the former ha fail to cite all the sourc for exampl aristid apolog c ad 138 probabl us arrenomanei androbaten and arsenokoitia all with the same basic mean of male homosexu 133 contrari to boswel s discuss boswel fail to cite hippolytu refut omn haer 5 26 22 23 and improperli cite eusebiu and the syriac writer bardensan the latter us syriac term that ar ident to the syriac of i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 133 34 next wright show how the earli church father us arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria refer to male homosexu with teenag the domin form of male homosexu among the greek 134 sometim thi parallel occur in the threefold list of moicheia adulteri porneia fornic and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replac paidophthori 136 clement of alexandria in protr 10 108 5 cite the second tabl of the ten command as you shall not kill ou moicheusei you shall not commit adulteri ou paidophthoresei you shall not practic homosexu with boi you shall not steal 150 n 43 anoth occurr of arsenokoitein commit homosexu exist in the sibyllin oracl 2 71 73 it mai be wright observ that the word wa coin by a jewish pre christian writer in a hellenist set repres by or sib book 2 137 38 wright also discuss us of arsenokoitai in rhetoriu 6th c who drew upon the first centuri ad writer teucer in macariu 4th 5th c and in john the faster d 595 139 40 the last in particular bear the idea of homosexu intercours contrari to boswel wright next repli to boswel s content that the term would not be absent from so much literatur about homosexu if that is what it denot 140 41 wright point out that it should not be expect in writer prior to the first centuri ad sinc it did not exist befor then that the greek us dozen of word and phrase to refer to homosexu that some sourc e g didach show no acquaint with paul s letter or deliber avoid cite scriptur and that boswel neglect cite sever church father 140 41 boswel s treatment of chrysostom in particular draw wright s attent 141 44 boswel conspicu misrepres the wit of chrysostom omit refer and assert what is patent untru chrysostom give a long uncompromis and clear indict of homosexu in hi homili on rom 1 26 boswel ha exagger chrysostom s infrequ us of the term wright observ that boswel ha signal fail to demonstr ani us of arsenokoit etc in which it patent doe not denot male homosexu activ 144 it is infrequ becaus of it rel technic natur and the avail of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearli specifi the prevail form of male homosexu in the greco roman world wright also survei the latin syriac and coptic translat of i tim and i cor all three render arsenokoitai with word that reflect the mean homosexu i e thei understand arseno as the object of the second half of the word 144 45 none of these primari version support boswel s limit conclus base on them wright conclud hi discuss with a few observ about the catalogu of vice as a literari form he believ that such list develop in late judaism as hellenist jew wrote in clear condemn of homosexu in the greek world thi parallel the increas concern on the part of moral philosoph over homosexu indulg the term came into be under the influenc of the lxx 145 so that writer spoke gener of male activ with male rather than specif categor male sexual engag with paid 146 if arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchang it is becaus the former encompass the latter 146 in summari wright seek to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term mean homosexu and aris with judaism the view of boswel scrogg and other who limit the term to activ male prostitut or pederasti ar without signific support from linguist and histor studi next the question of wright posit by william peterson after that we get into the good stuff of histor linguist studi thi will includ symposium by plato if there is ani doubt as to the modern understand of homosexu be understood or contemmpl at the time of paul thi will certainli clear thing up also we will review paul s us of lev18 20 in the nt and how as for him 1 the law wa fulfil but not done awai with 2 lev 18 20 wa the univers and the follow chapter the gener those who put forth that the ot no longer hold true todai in our cultur should stick around for thi on
