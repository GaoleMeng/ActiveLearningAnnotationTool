arithmet problem profession mathematician were no except here s what the russian mathematician alexand khinchin a specialist in statist wrote about arithmet i willingli confess that ani time a fifth grader ask me to help solv an arithmet problem it wa a hard work for me and sometim i fail complet of cours like most of my friend i could easili solv the problem by the natur algebra rout construct equat or set of equat but we were suppos to avoid us algebra analysi at all cost by the wai it s a fact that is well known and oft repeat that as a rule neither high school graduat nor student at teach colleg nor teacher begin their career nor i must add scientif research can solv arithmet problem it seem the onli peopl in the world who ar abl to solv them ar fifth grade teacher now i m not insist that a book of arithmet problem be includ in the bookbag of anyon fly into space but a sens of justic induc me to recommend on particular problem book on that will satisfi the most fastidi tast

everi dai i illumin the ey of my mind feel myself lack in the art of calcul i came to the conclus that it is fruitless to studi philosophi the mother of all scienc without number i could find in armenia neither a man vers in philosophi nor book that explain the scienc i therefor went to greec and met in theodosiopl a man name iliazar who wa well vers in ecclesiast work he told me that in forth armenia 2 there live a famou mathematician christosatur i went thi person and spent six month with him but soon i notic that christosatur wa a master not of all scienc but onli of certain fragmentari fact i then went to constantinopl where i met acquaint who told me why did you go so far when much closer to us in trebizon on the coast of pontu 3 live the byzantin vardapet tyukhik he is full of wisdom is known to king and know armenian literatur i ask them how thei knew thi thei answer we saw ourselv that mani peopl travel long distanc to becom pupil of so learn a man inde the

lord bestow upon me hi bless i complet assimil the scienc of number and with such success that my fellow student at the king s court began to envi me i spent eight year with tyukhik and studi mani book that had not been translat into our languag for the vardapet had an innumer collect of book secret and explicit ecclesiast and pagan book on art histori and medicin book of chronolog why enumer them by titl in a word there is no book that tyukhik did not have and he had such a gift from the holi spirit for translat that when he sat down to translat someth from the greek into armenian he did not struggl as other translat did and the translat read as if the work were written in that languag origin tyukhik told me how he had achiev such vast erudit and how he had learn the armenian languag when i wa young he said i live in trebizon at the court of the militari chief ioannu patricu and for a long time up to the access of mauritiu to the throne i serv as a militari man in armenia and

to constantinopl i met a famou philosoph from athen and studi with him for mani year after that i return to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my peopl after some year that philosoph di not find a replac for him the king and hi courtier sent for tyukhik and invit him to assum the teacher s posit tyukhik cite the promis he made to god not to move far from the citi turn down the offer but becaus of hi wide lean peopl came stream from all countri to studi with him and i the most insignific of all armenian have learn from him thi power scienc desir by king brought it to our countri support by no on oblig onli to my own industri god s help and the prayer of the bless educ and no on thank me for my effort problem and solut a half and on sixth and on nine ninth of all the book were print on verg on fifth and on two hundr eighti fifth on rag paper on forti fifth and on eight hundr fifti fifth on vellum and forti five inscrib copi on dutch paper and so find how mani copi were print in all imit of anania of shirak a latin proverb sai habent sua fata libelli book have their own fate the fate of problem and solut by anania of shirak is quit amaz the manuscript of anania s book were preserv onli becaus accord to armenian historian in ancient and mediev armenia manuscript were guard from invad like weapon and cherish like on s own children bide their time the manuscript lai in the matenadaran a renown depositori of ancient manuscript now the mesrop mashtot institut of ancient manuscript and it hour final arriv in 1896 the learn monk father kaloust us two manuscript to publish the problem book supplement it with an introduct and commentari in 1918 the book wa translat into russian edit annot and typeset by iosef orb a promin scholar and later a member of the academi of scienc of the ussr in the translat s word the problem of anania ar amus full of life and simpl orb goe on to sai the subject of the problem ar gener taken from everydai life the scene is predominantli hi homeland shirak and the surround countrysid and the dramati persona if thei ar name ar the local princ the kamsarakan includ nersekh who wa a contemporari of anania like other ancient author anania of shirak us onli aliquot that is fraction with a numer of 1 when it is necessari to write fraction with numer other than 1 on ha to repres it as a sum of aliquot see the epigraph abov like ani true work of art the problem of anania suffer terribl in the retel you have to read the origin albeit in translat in their full glori so let s open anania s problem book a gift from across the ag problem 1 and 8 relat to the armenian upris against the persian in a d 572 problem 1 my father told me the follow stori dure the famou war between the armenian and the persian princ zaurak kamsarakan perform extraordinari heroic deed three time in a singl month he attack the persian troop the first time he struck down half of the persian armi the second time pursu the persian he slaughter on fourth of the soldier the third time he destroi on eleventh of the persian armi the persian who were still aliv number two hundr eighti fled to nakhichevan and so from thi remaind find how mani persian soldier there were befor the massacr problem 8 dure the famou armenian upris against the persian when zaurak kamsarakan kill suren on of the armenian azat 4 sent an envoi to the persian king to report the bale new the envoi cover fifti mile in a dai fifteen dai later when he learn of thi zaurak kamsarakan sent rider in pursuit to bring the envoi back the rider cover eighti mile in a dai and so find how mani dai it took them to catch the envoi problem 18 mention vessel made of vari amount of metal in the russian translat thei ar all call dish but in the origin armenian accord to orb s note the dish in the first and second instanc ar call mesur and in the third instanc scutel scutel is a common armenian word but mesur had not been encount in armenian literatur befor anania s problem and solut problem 18 there wa a trai in my hous i melt it down and made other vessel from the metal from on third i made a mesur from on fourth anoth mesur from on fifth two goblet from on sixth two scutel and from two hundr ten dram i made a bowl and now find the weight of the trai sever of the problem reflect the rich of the caucasian fauna in anania s time for instanc problem 7 problem 7 onc i wa in marmet the capit of the kamsarakan stroll along the bank of the river akhuryan i saw a school of fish and order that a net be cast we caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fish that slip out of the net end up in a creel when i look in the creel i found forti five fish and now find how mani fish here were in all the temptat is great to present all 24 problem but i ll restrain myself and offer you just on more problem 20 provid some interest inform about the wild anim that inhabit armenia at on time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoolog refer book the wild donkei accord to the gener accept view never roam the armenian land yet anania of shirak offer evid to the contrari problem 20 the hunt preserv of nersekh kamsarakan ter 5 of shirak and asharunik wa at the base of the mountain call artin on night great herd of wild donkei enter the preserv the hunter could not cope with the donkei and run to the villag of talin told nersekh about them when he arriv with hi brother and azat and enter the preserv thei began kill the wild beast half of the anim were caught in trap on fourth were kill by arrow the young which constitut on twelfth of all the anim were caught aliv and three hundr sixti wild donkei were kill by spear and so find how mani beast there were at the start of thi massacr set in type by me iosef orb hi biographi could not be squeez into the framework of a bibliographi k uzbashyan academician iosef abgarovich orb anyon who is lucki enough to hold a copi 1 n of the small print n is the solut to the epigraph in the previou section of the russian translat of anania of shirak s problem and solut a thin book with yellow page ha probabl notic the varieti of the font the eleg of the

attest to the profession matur of the man who creat it an advertis at the end of the book read thi book wa typeset in decemb 1917 at the print offic of the russian academi of scienc by me iosef orb the text wa also proofread laid out and decor with border by me variou circumst prevent me from carri thi project to the end the final page of the book were typeset by m strolman typeset wa neither
