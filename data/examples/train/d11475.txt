secreci in clipper chip the serial number of the clipper chip is encrypt with the system kei and transmit as on part of a three part messag presum the protocol can be recov if by noth els differenti analysi postul if you will a chip or logic sit between the clipper chip and it commun channel the purpos of thi chip is twofold 1 transmit channel the spoof chip xor the 30 bit encrypt serial number with a secondari kei variabl thi render the serial number unrecover with just the system kei 2 reciev channel the spoof chip xor the incom encrypt serial number with a secondari kei variabl assum the serial number is necessari for local oper thi ha the net result of hide the serial number thi get more interest when the number of serial number issu becom larg make it difficult to distinguish between valid serial number and a spoof serial number without know the system kei you could lie about the serial number but risk detect of the lie if you had the system kei and the encrypt algorithm you could successfulli lie with a lower probabl of detect by emul the format of your own serial number make you wonder what be hidden here seem like the secreci is to prevent you from ly about who you ar
