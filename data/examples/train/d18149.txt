1982 bruce r mcconki made the follow remark about prai to jesu anoth peril is that those so involv often begin to prai directli to christ becaus of some special friendship thei feel ha been develop thi is plain sectarian nonsens our prayer ar address to the father and to him onli perfect prayer is address to the father in the name of the son it is utter by the power of the holi ghost our relationship with the lord pp 19 20 mcconki state on p 335 of hi book promis messiah that the mormon prai to the father not the son on p 306 of the same book mcconki state that christ the son is jehovah thi is import to rememb becaus although mcconki said prayer is not to be offer to the mormon christ who is jehovah the bibl state repeatedli in the ot that peopl prai to jehovah and he not onli heard those prayer but he accept them as valid request the follow is but a small sampl of the vast number of time peopl prai to jehovah in my distress i call upon the lord jehovah and cri unto my god elohim he heard my voic out of hi templ and my cry came befor him even into hi ear ps 18 6 and the lord jehovah said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplic that thou hast made befor me i have hallow thi hous which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine ey and mine heart shall be there perpetu 1 kin 9 3 and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplic

to the prayer of thy servant who desir to fear thy name neh 1 11 and it wa so that when solomon had made an end of prai all thi prayer and supplic unto the lord jehovah he aros from befor the altar of the lord jehovah from kneel on hi knee with hi hand spread up to heaven 1 kin 8 54 he went in therefor and shut the door upon them twain and prai unto the lord jehovah 2 kin 4 33 go and sai to

mayest be found ps 32 5 6 notic abov in ps 32 6 that the godli prai to jehovah accord to mcconki and other mormon leader that is christ the veri on to whom mcconki said peopl should not prai the bibl reveal there is onli on true elohim and hi name is jehovah all other elohim ar fals thei ar idol that caus their follow to commit adulteri against the true elohim and idolatri for the lord jehovah is great and greatli to be prais he is to be fear abov all god elohim for all the god elohim of the nation ar idol but the lord jehovah made the heaven ps 96 4 5 thou shalt have no other god elohim befor me exod 20 3 now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all god elohim exod 18 11 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other god elohim and serv them and worship them i testifi against you thi dai that ye shall sure perish deut 8 19 thou shalt make no coven with them nor with their god elohim thei shall not dwell in thy land lest thei make thee sin against me for if thou serv their god elohim it will sure be a snare unto thee exod 23 32 33 take heed to yourselv that your heart be not deceiv and ye turn asid and serv other god elohim and worship them deut 11 16 that ye come not among these nation these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their god elohim nor caus to swear by them neither serv them nor bow yourselv unto them josh 23 7 neither walk after other god elohim to your hurt jer 7 6 but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the live god elohim jer 10 10 and thei forsook the lord jehovah god elohim of their father which brought them out of the land of egypt and follow other god elohim of the god elohim of the peopl that were round about them and bow themselv unto them and provok the lord jehovah to anger jud 2 12 shall a man make god elohim unto himself and thei ar no god elohim therefor behold i will thi onc caus them to know i will caus them to know mine hand and my might and thei shall know that my name is the lord jehovah jer 16 20 21 and if it seem evil unto you to serv the lord jehovah choos you thi dai whom ye will serv whether the god elohim which your father serv that were on the other side of the flood or the god elohim of the amorit in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my hous we will serv the lord jehovah and the peopl answer and said god elohim forbid that we should forsak the lord jehovah to serv other god elohim josh 24 15 16 these vers teach that the onli true live elohim in heaven and on earth is jehovah the triun god who made heaven and earth and all therein jehovah is greater than ani elohim becaus all other elohim ar idol the realiti behind them is demon deut 32 17 jehovah elohim ha given explicit warn and guidelin regard these fals elohim he told hi peopl not to have ani elohim but him he told the peopl that if thei left him for the fals elohim those elohim would be a snare to them and thei would be hurt and would perish he warn the peopl to take heed that their heart be not deceiv into worship serv swear by and make coven with fals elohim jehovah elohim told hi peopl he would eventu judg all fals elohim and their follow despit these warn and guidelin elohim s coven peopl forsook him and believ in and worship the fals elohim s of the peopl thei came in contact with ju 10 6 state that the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and serv baalim and ashtaroth and the god elohim of syria and the god elohim of zidon and the god elohim of moab and the god elohim of the children of ammon and the god elohim of the philistin and forsook the lord jehovah and serv not him thi examin ha shown that the elohim of mormon like the elohim in ju 10 6 is not the true jehovah elohim therefor the peopl who leav the true elohim for the mormon elohim will do evil in the sight of the lord jehovah although mcconki attack christian for their belief in a triun god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah sent hi son into the world these belief ar true god is triun he is spirit he is jehovah and he did send hi son into the world to redeem mankind it is obviou from thi examin that it is not the christian who thrash around in dark about who elohim and jehovah ar on wonder what holi writ mcconki had in mind when he state that it attest to the fact that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son he certainli did not mean the bibl which teach that the father son and holi spirit ar all the on jehovah elohim he appar did not mean the d c either becaus chapter 109 vers 1 4 9 10 14 19 22 24 29 34 42 47 56 68 77 refer to the father as jehovah summari obvious joseph field smith s statement that the mormon have a clear and perfect understand of the natur of god doctrin of salvat 1 279 is not accur the mormon god ar not the true god as mormon claim but ar idol which caus their follow to commit adulteri against god and idolatri in answer to

come onli by worship the true god promis messiah p 163 mcconki also rightli state that the mere worship of a god who ha the proper scriptur name doe not assur on that he is worship the true and live god becaus the true name of deiti can be appli to fals concept of god mormon doctrin p 270 rememb that the apostl stephen l richard admit that joseph smith jr gave a new concept of god and the godhead contribut of joseph smith p 1 it is import for the peopl who have left the true triun god reveal in the bibl to repent and return to him thei must forsak the sin of idolatri and adulteri which thei ar commit in mormon the bibl sai all that forsak thee shall be asham and thei that depart from me shall be written in the earth becaus thei have forsaken the lord jehovah the fountain of live water jer
