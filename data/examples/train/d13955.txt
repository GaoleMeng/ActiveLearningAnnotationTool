from graydon saundrsg qucdn queensu ca if all of these thing have been detect in space ha anyon look into possibl problem with the detector that is is there some mechan cosmic rai whatev that could caus the dector to _think_ it wa see on of these thing graydon that would not explain why wide separ detector such as on ulyss and pvo and ginga et al would see a burst at the same time in fact be fore bats have thi wide separ interplanetari network wa the onli sure wai to locat a random burst with onli on detector on cannot locat a burst except to sai it s somewher in the field of view with two detector on can us the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the locat to a thin annulu on the sky with three detector on get intersect annuli give two possibl locat if on of these locat is imposs becaus sai the earth block that part of the sky voila you have an error box bats by have 8 detector of it own can do it own locat determin but onli to within about 3 degre would someon at gsfc like david like to comment on the current state of locat determin have ind pendent sight by other detector help drive down the uncertainti you did touch on someth that you didn t mean to though some believ in a refer that i have somewher that absorpt like featur seen in a fraction of grb can actual be caus by the detector it would be a mean nasti god though that would have a nai crystal act like a 10 12 gauss neutron star but thi is get too far afield peter peterf oddjob uchicago edu
