ac uk simon dc warwick ac uk simon clippingdal write alarm amount of agreement delet i made my statement about ockum razor from my experi in physic thank for info in baysian statist veri interest and i didn t know it befor i follow your proof but i have on question we have two hypothes h and hg the latter is more complic which by definit mean p h p hg that complic isn t in fact where p h p hg come from it s more the other wai around it s from p h p hg p hg where g is the complement of g and by axiom p anyth 0 so p hg 0 so p h p hg in a sens hg is necessarili more complic than h for ani h and g so i mai be split hair but what i m try to sai is that irrespect of subject impress of how complic someth is p h p hg hold with equal if and onli if p hg 0 as you point out it s a veri simpl matter to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x and thu h is to be preferd to hg now to sai that h is as consist with the data as hg is to sai p x h p x hg can you elabor some on thi well p x a p x b mean that x is as like to be observ if a is oper as it is if b is oper thi impli that observ x doe not provid ani us inform which might allow us to discrimin between the respect possibl that a and b ar oper the differ reduc to the differ between the unknown and unhelp prior probabl p a and p b p x a p x b p a x k p a and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x so a and b ar equal consist with the data in that observ x doesn t give ani pointer as to which of a or b is oper in the particular case where a h and b hg howev we know that their prior probabl ar order by p h p hg although we don t know the actual valu and it s thi which allow us to deploi the razor to throw out ani such hg also in the real world it isn t as clear cut and dry it seem to me we can t alwai determin whether the equal p x h p x hg is true that s certainli true but the particular point here wa whether or not a divin compon actual underli the preval of religion in addit to the memet transmiss compon which even the religi implicitli acknowledg to be oper when thei talk of spread the word now it seem to me as i ve said that the observ varianc in religi belief is well account for by the memet transmiss model but rather less well if on propos a divin compon in addit sinc i would expect the latter to conspir against wide varianc and even mutual exclus among belief thu my person feel is that p x hg isn t even equal to p x h in thi case but is smaller h is memet transmiss g is divin compon x is the varianc among belief but i happili acknowledg that thi is a subject impress btw my beef with your baysian argument wa not a mathemat on i check most of your work and didn t find an error and you seem veri care so there probabl isn t a math mistak i think the mistak is philosoph but just to make sure i understand you can pleas rephras it in non technic term i think thi is a reason request i alwai try to look for wai of explain physic to non physicist i m not a baysian statistician nor ani type of statistician so thi would be veri help not that i m a statistician as such either but the idea is that both theism and atheism ar compat with all of the read my observ to date howev theism of the type with which i am concern also suggest that for instanc prayer mai be answer peopl mai be miracul heal both ar in principl amen to statist verif and that god s mai gener interven in measur wai thi mean that these region of the space of possibl observ which i loos term appear of god s have some nonzero probabl under the theistic hypothesi and zero under the atheist sinc there is onli so much probabl avail for each hypothesi to scatter around over the observ space the probabl which theism expend on make appear of god s possibl must come from somewher els i e other possibl observ all els be equal thi mean that an observ which isn t an appear of god s must have a slightli higher probabl under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff impli that such observ must caus my run estim for the probabl of the atheist hypothesi to increas with a correspond decreas in my run estim for the probabl of the theistic hypothesi sorri if that s still a bit jargonesqu but it s rather difficult to put it ani other wai sinc it doe depend intim on the properti of condit probabl densiti and particularli that the total area under them is alwai uniti an analog mai or mai not be help sai that hypothesi a is the coin is fair and that b is the coin is unfair two head i ve us a and b to avoid confus with h head and t tail then p h a 0 5 total 1 p t a 0 5 p h b 1 total 1 p t b 0 the observ ar a string of head with no tail thi is compat with both a fair coin a and a two head coin b howev the probabl expend by a on make possibl the appear of tail even though thei don t actual appear must come from somewher els sinc the total must be uniti and it come in thi case from the probabl of the appear of head sai our run estim at time n 1 ar e n 1 a and e n 1 b the observ x n at time n is anoth head x n h the estim ar modifi accord to p h a e n a e n 1 a e n 1 a m p h and p h b e n b e n 1 b e n 1 b 2m p h now we don t know p h the actual prior probabl of a head but the multipli for e a is half that for e b thi is true everi time the coin is toss and a head is observ thu whatev the initi valu of the estim after n head we have n e n a m e 0 a and n e n b 2m e 0 b and sinc e k a e k b 1 at ani time k you can show that 0 5 m 1 and thu 1 2m 2 henc the estim for the fair coin hypothesi a must decreas at each trial and that for the two head coin hypothesi b must increas even though both hypothes ar compat with a string of head the loos analog is between unfair coin and atheism and between fair coin and theism with observ consist with both a tail which would falsifi unfair coin is analog to an appear of god s which would falsifi atheism i am not claim that the analog extend to the numer valu of the variou probabl just that the principl is the same constant observ of no evid for god if evid for them is at all possibl under the respect theism constantli increas the notion estim probabl that thei don t exist it s import to draw a distinct between theism that could be support or not support by evid and theism that can t given a theism for which evid is in principl not possibl it doesn t make sens to sai lack of evid support the contrari view quit so but thi type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg in term of our ockham s razor discuss and i d bin it on those ground so it depend upon your concept of thi god if it s a concept like zeu who happen to come down to earth to plai quit frequent then i agre with you lack of evid for thi concept of god is evid that it doe not exist but if your concept of god is on that doe not make falsifi predict see below on falsifi predict then i disagre lack of evid doe not support a disbelief the hypothes don t have to be falsifi and inde in my model the theism isn t falsifi i us the phrase should obvers given ani specif x theism doe not make the predict p x ht 0 that s why i us the word should theism make no predict about ani specif event i can onli sai i believ that god did such and such after such and such happen or i believ god will do such and such but for ani given x i can never a priori sai p x ht 0 i can not even sai thi for the set of all x or some x thi is what don t like about your us of probabl we also have no wai of assign these probabl i hold scienc to positivist criteria if someon cannot tell me how to measur even in principl p x h then probabl is not applic to hypothesi h such is the case when h ht theistic and ha atheist for exampl p x ha p x ha p ha what is p ha how do i measur it you don t have to we don t need in the abov analog to know ani prior probabl to deduc that the updat multipli for the fair coin hypothesi is less than uniti and that the correspond multipli for the two head coin hypothesi is greater than uniti you don t need to know the initi valu of the run estim either it s clear that after a larg number of observ p fair coin approach zero and p two head coin approach uniti all you need to know is whether p x ha is larger than p x ht for observ x and thi follow from the assumpt that there ar certain event render possibl not necessari under ht which ar not possibl under ha and all els is equal baysian statist reli upon a seri of observ but what if the hypothesi isn t amen to observ and even for statement that ar amen to observ some observ ar not relev a sequenc of observ must be chosen with care i m curiou to know what type of observ x 1 x 2 you have in mind concern theism and atheism ani observ you like it realli doesn t matter nor affect the reason provid that there ar some possibl observ which would count as appear of god s exampl of thi might be a demonstr of the efficaci of prayer or of the verac of revel but ani statement about p x h for gener x still count as a predict of h if the theism in question ht sai that prayer mai be answer or that miracl mai happen see my interpret quot again abov of what god exist mean then thi is a predict p x ht 0 for such x it s what distinguish it from the atheist hypothesi ha which predict that thi stuff doe not happen p x ha 0 for such x theism doe not make the claim that p x ht 0 for such x or i should sai that my theism doesn t mayb i wa too quick to sai we had a common languag you said that by the exist of god you mean the notion that the deiti describ by the bibl and by christian doe interact with the univers as claim by those agent i agre with thi howev i must be care here i believ thi i m not make ani claim mayb i should have chang doe to can there is an import shift of emphasi but ani wai sinc i onli have a belief i cannot conclud p x ht 0 for such x ok we ll downgrad doe interact to mai interact which would actual be better sinc doe interact impli a falsifi which we both agre is misplac i don t think my theism make predict mayb i m not understand what you mean by predict could you explain what you mean by thi word i ll explain but bear in mind that thi isn t central all i requir of a theism is that it not make the predict appear of god s will never happen as doe atheism befor somebodi point out that quantum mechan doesn t make thi predict either the differ is that qm and atheism do not form a partit predict includ such statement as prayer is efficaci impli if you do the stat you will find that prayer is efficaci or prayer is not efficaci or verili i sai unto you thi gener shall not pass till all these thing be fulfil i don t think we have ani problem of misunderstand here persist observ of thi stuff not happen consist with ht though it mai be is more consist with ha as explain in the bayesian stat post even if ht god exist is unfalsifi that s no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number of observ go to infin to falsifi it asymptot btw i do not consid an argument that requir an infinit number of observ as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid we as exist human can never make an infinit number of measur and ani conclus that reili on thi i don t accept as valid that s fine i don t claim that theism is fals mere that the finit number of observ avail to me so far suggest that it is and that as i continu to observ the suggest look better and better renorm stuff delet in the bayesian stat post i assum that theism wa inde unfalsifi in a finit number of observ here s the relev quot $ the import assumpt is that there ar some observ which $ ar compat with the theist hypothesi and not with the atheist $ hypothesi and thu would falsifi atheism these ar what i call $ appear of god s but thi need not be taken too liter ani $ observ which requir for it explan that on or more god $ exist will count all other observ ar assum to be compat $ with both hypothes thi leav theism as unfalsifi and atheism $ as falsifi in a singl observ onli by such appear of $ god s here is my problem with thi for someth to be falsifi it must make the predict that x should not be seen if x is seen then the hypothesi ha been falsifi now atheism is a word in oposit to someth theism a theism asert a belief and an atheism asert a disbelief so there ar certain atheism that ar certainli falsifi just as there ar certain theism that ar falsif e g if my theism assert the world is onli 6 000 year old and that god doe not deciev then thi ha been falsifi howev the atheism that is in oposit to an unfalsifi theism is also unfalsifi i could be wrong on thi statment contd i think you ar an appear of god s is suffici to falsifi atheism wherea in gener the correspond theism is unfalsifi i ll think more about it until then here is a gener question supps x were unfalsifi is not x also unfalsifi no by wai of a counterexampl let x the coin is fair or more accur so that not x make sens the two side of the coin ar differ thi is unfalsifi by toss the coin even a string of head is consist with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinit number of toss to falsifi x in the limit it convers is falsifi and is falsifi when at least on head and at least on tail have appear thi is partli what s wrong with you baysian argument which requir observ x 1 x n to be made there ar simpli no such observ that have a truth valu in relat to the statement god exist now by us of your symmetri argument i can understand why someon would sai sinc the statement god doe not exist make no predict i will choos not to believ it but none the less thi would be found on a type of faith or if you don t like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifi evid instead i ll assum you meant god exist up there at the highlight but by our agre definit of exist the statement make predict as i said abov although it isn t falsifi in a finit number of observ actual i mean god doe not exist make no predict oop sorri mea culpa the truth of thi statment actual depend upon which god you ar refer to but i can think of some concept of god for which it is true but onc again i m open to the posibl that i could be wrong so give me some exampl of predict of the statment god doe not exist here is on that i can think of if true then there would be no heal or miricl but thi can in principl never be determin on wai or the other there ar case in which peopl seem to recov and ar heal without the help of a doctor and for no known reason these situat do in fact happen thei ar consist with a theistic hypothesi but in no wai support such a hypothesi we agre here thei ar not inconsist with an atheist hypothesi i can t think of on predict from god doe not exist that isn t of thi type but i might be miss someth the raptur will not happen on octob 28 1992 said raptur would have falsifi atheism to my satisfact had it happen although it failur to happen doe not of cours falsifi ani theism other than those which specif predict it no phenomenon which requir the exist of on or more god for it explan will ever be observ that about sum
