argu that your latter statement i believ that no god exist doe rest upon faith that is if you ar make a posit statement that no god exist strong atheism rather than mere sai i don t know and therefor don t believ in them and don t not believ in then weak atheism onc again to not believ in god is differ than sai i believ that god doe not exist i still maintain the posit even after read the faq that strong atheism requir faith no it in the wai it is usual us in my view you ar sai here that drive a car requir faith that the car drive i m not sai thi at all it requir no faith on my part to sai the car drive becaus i ve seen it drive i ve done more than at in fact i ve actual driven it now what doe requir some faith is the belief that my sens give an accur represent of what s out there but there is no evid pro or con for the exist or non exist of god see what i have to sai below on thi for me it is a conclus and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premis and the argument us sorri if i remain skeptic i don t believ it s entir a conclus that you have seen no evid that there is a god is correct neither have i but lack of evid for the exist of someth is in no wai evid for the non exist of someth the creationist have a similar mode of argument in which if thei disprov evolut the establish creation you person have never seen a neutrino befor but thei exist the pink unicorn analog break down and is rather naiv i have a scientif theori that explain the appear of anim life evolut when i draw the conclus that pink unicorn don t exist becaus i haven t seen them thi conclus ha it s foundat in observ and theori a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualit similar to other known entiti that is to sai sinc there is good evid that all life on earth ha evolv from more primit ancestor these pink unicorn would share a common anscestori with hors and zebra and such god howev ha no such correspond with anyth imo there is no physic frame work of observ to draw ani conclus from but first let me sai the follow we might have a languag problem here in regard to faith and exist i as a christian maintain that god doe not exist to exist mean to have be in space and time god doe not have be god is be kierkegaard onc said that god doe not exist he is etern with thi said i feel it s rather pointless to debat the so call exist of god and that is not what i m do here i believ that god is the sourc and ground of be when you sai that god doe not exist i also accept thi statement but we obvious mean two differ thing by it howev in what follow i will us the phrase the exist of god in it s usual sens and thi is the sens that i think you ar us it i would like a clarif upon what you mean by the exist of god no that s a word game i disagre with you profoundli on thi i haven t defin god as exist in fact i haven t defin god but thi might be get off the subject although if you think it s relev we can come back to it further sai god is exist is either a wast of time exist is alreadi us and there is no need to replac it by god or you ar impli more with it in which case your definit and your argument so far ar incomplet make it a fallaci you ar us wrong categori here or perhap you misunderstand what i m sai i m make no argument what so ever and offer no definit so there is no fallaci i m not try to convinc you of anyth i believ and that rest upon faith and it is inappropri to appli the categori of logic in thi realm unless someon tell you that thei can logic prove god or that thei have evid or then the us of logic to disprov their claim if fine and necessari btw an incomplet argument is not a fallaci some thing ar not even wrong delet on can never prove that god doe or doe not exist when you sai that you believ god doe not exist and that thi is an opinion base upon observ i will have to ask what observt ar you refer to there ar no observ pro or con that ar valid here in establish a posit belief delet where doe that follow aren t observ base on the assumpt that someth exist i don t follow you here certainli on can make observ of thing that thei didn t know exist i still maintain that on cannot us observ to infer that god doe not exist such a posit assert requir a leap and wouldn t you sai there is a level of definit that the assumpt god is is meaning if not i would reject that concept anywai so where is your evid for that god is is meaning at some level onc again you seem to complet misunderstand me i have no evid that god is is meaning at ani level mayb such a respons as you gave just come natur to you becaus so mani peopl try to run their own privat concept of god down your throat i howev am not do thi i am argu on and onli on thing that to make a posit assert about someth for which there can in principl be no evid for or against requir a leap it requir faith i am as you would sai a theist howev there is a form of atheism that i can respect but it must be found upon honesti benedikt bob singleton bob thnext mit edu
