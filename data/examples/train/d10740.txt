thi announc is somewhat disconcert it doesn t do anyth evil in and of itself but bode badli for the futur of open algorithm and standard in inform secur i won t start panick until unless de or rsa or stuff like that is prohibit but i m a littl anxiou no doubt it won t be long befor someon post explain how thi just a small part of some far rang and long live nsa pkp ir fbi cia handguncontrolinc clinton conspiraci to subvert freedom democraci and mathemat my feel is that the administr probabl isn t that worri about thing like de and rsa and pgp and ripem sinc thei ll never be us by a group much wider than us comput geek the fact that thi just came out now suggest on of two thing 1 the nsa ha been work on thi for a long time and it onli just now happen to be readi to releas to the world at thi time 2 the nsa ha been work on thi for a long time but wasn t abl to get the bush administr to go along with thi plan i find it unlik that thi would have been becaus of a sympathi for the unescrow us of cryptographi more like the administr felt that even escrow secret algorithm and for all we know trivial breakabl cryptographi should not be made wide avail thu said clipper csrc ncsl nist gov clipper chip announc thi new technolog will help compani protect proprietari inform protect the privaci of person phone convers and prevent unauthor releas of data transmit electron at the same time thi technolog preserv the abil of feder state and local law enforc agenc to intercept lawfulli the phone convers of crimin the major of the discuss involv thi clipper chip seem to pertain to the encrypt of telephon convers doe anyon know if that mean thi chip is design to work primarili with analog signal the languag sort of suggest thi but it s hard to sai the main thing i just don t get is whether thi chip implement symmetr or asymmetr cryptograph techniqu anybodi know i m guess symmetr but thei don t get veri clear about it if it is symmetr how is it us for anyth other than link level encrypt with an ident chip at each end how can you negoti a per session kei us symmetr cryptographi without us a trust third parti who know your kei or doe it even us a per session kei if it s asymmetr what about pkp s patent which thei claim cover all method of do asymmetr cryptographi ar thei get royalti or is hide infring the real reason for keep the algorithm secret marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu mime ripem accept kirk i won t hurt you alien you hit me kirk well i won t hit you again
