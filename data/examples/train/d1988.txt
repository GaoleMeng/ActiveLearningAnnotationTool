in articl 1993apr15 093231 5148 new yale edu steve tomassi write hi basebal fan so what do you sai don t you think he deserv it i mean heck if dave winfield ho hum is serious be consid for it as is lee smith ha then why don t we give dave kingman a chanc or darrel evan yeah yeah after the hall of fame take in them it can take in eddi murrai and jeff reardon oh yeah dave winfield margin player gui didn t hit a lick had neglig power wa a crap fielder and had no stai power dave winfield now enter hi i believ 20th big leagu season is still a damn decent hitter admittedli hi defens ha slip a great deal but in hi prime he had a power arm and great rang take a look at the stat i don t know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman ar similar player kingman wa a on dimens power hitter he couldn t field he ran like an anvil hit for a low averag though if i rememb right hi obp wasn t that hideou and for those who consid such thing import wa a absolut primo dick eddi murrai yup onli the best 1st baseman of the 80 s i know that mvp vote ar conduct by mediot but given that he got job out of the mvp he deserv in 1983 it seem that he wasn t overr by the media lee smith hmmmm thi on s actual pretti close he s had a s solid depend career as a closer despit pitch in some nasti park wriglei fenwai i d have to take a closer look at the stat it s been a while but it seem lee arthur is of hof calib you do make a legitim point about the hof credenti of reliev simpli rack up a lot of save doesn t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simpli becaus minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta us reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been on the equal ha rack up an impress number of save no wai should homerman be in the hof imho darrel evan nice career actual a bit underr kinda like ted simmon imho but not a hof er well in ani case i am sick and tire mostli sick of everybodi give hall of fame consider to player that ar by todai s standard margin lemm ask you thi who the hell plai the game isn t margin honestli ozzi smith and robin yount don t belong there thei re both shortstop that just hung around for a long time big deal let s be a littl more select huh stop hand out these honor so liber save them for the gui who realli deserv it face it if someth now wait a goddamn minut here ozzi smith absolut redefin the posit of shortstop hi defens wa so good that he s won someth along the line of 10 gold glove again gold glove ar mediot bias and a good argument could be made that larkin deserv on or two of ozzi s more recent award but usual thi is temper by someon els in the earli 80 s get the gold glove ozzi deserv earlier in hi career ozzi s offens you ask good obp great speed number in a park which for most of hi career depress offens admittedli no power cept against tom niedenfu but still a definit asset offens yount 3 000 hit mvp at two differ posit uh huh a real stiff hi 82 wa on of the great year ever by a player in recent memori and probabl rank behind onli the peak season of wagner and bank as far as ss number go he s a clear hof er imho isn t done there will be littl prestig in the hall of fame anymor when certain individu believ that steve garvei or jack morri ar potenti candid the absurd is appar gee can these gui even compar to the more like futur hall of famer like kirbi puckett or nolan ryan well as far as garvei goe you re right garvei is a mediot candid push becaus of hi win attitud a minor factor if on at all and hi great defens no error admittedli but the rang of a tree stump garvei shouldn t be in the hof skyjack i ve said a lot of nasti thing about skyjack in the last year or so but thi is mostli in respons to mediot and woofer who talk about morri abil to win which is noth more than morri abil to pitch when toronto to score ton of run at thi point morri is an averag pitcher although from hi earli return in 93 he mai be damn close to done but in all fair morri wa a domin pitcher in the 80 s for up and down tiger team while 1984 wa obvious a great year for detroit the rest of the decad the team wa gener in content but not favorit morri career number ar quit good and worthi of hof consider ryan of cours but be care i guarante you that someon will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith be shortstop who hung around a long time after all nolan never won a cy damn he s just pitcher who hung around for 99 year hi w l record is mediocr of cours nolan s a hof er puck probabl although he s got to plai reason well for a few more year 10 year even good on aren t enough to make the hof most like that said i believ puckett will make the hof pretti much regardless of how the rest of hi career turn out bar someth realli tragic or sudden he s veri popular in the media and with fan and legitim ha been on of the best cf s in the game sinc he join the leagu i ve alwai like the gui and i hope he doe make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but realli it s too earli to sell thi debat come up rather frequent on the net and believ it or not i never tire of it it s an interest subject here s an off the top of my head list of potenti hof er from each team i probabl left a coupl of gui off so feel free to follow up i won t consid anyon who start plai after about 1985 again too earli to tell note these ar all activ player i m not count recent retire baltimor cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrig s record stand boston roger clemen might be a lock alreadi which is amaz dawson detroit alan trammel and lou whitak possibl milwauke robin yount discuss earlier new york wade bogg possibl mattingli long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morri possibl kansa citi georg brett lock minnesota kirbi too earli to tell winfield lock oakland eckerslei lock mcgwire too earli rickei lock welch long shot texa the mighti nolan too earli to consid canseco or strang cub sandberg lock st loui ozzi lock lee smith probabl new
