outsid in the hall for the benefit of everyon els everyon who wa there insid and outsid got to sign up on a sheet sai what their posit wa on which bill most of us sign up to support goal s posit on all bill first becaus of their time constraint public offici got to testifi and first up wa the bill that nobodi had seen the student had some curfew i guess current massachusett law allow a non resid to purchas long gun or ammo from a local dealer provid he compli with the law of hi own state previous the law wa similar but appli onli to non resid from state adjoin massachusett the simon s rock folk call the current law a loophol and want it close two of their rep spoke about wayn lo and hi sk assault rifl the second on hodgekiss a co sponsor had done hi homework so well that he kept confus montana wayn lo s home state with missouri and becam belliger when about five gun owner in the galleri correct him after hi second muff carr from gloucest claim that the new bill would put the law back the wai it wa but he wa ly the new bill allow purchas by non resid of adjoin state onli if thei have licens in their own state as strong as that in massachusett sinc none of them do that s that some of the thing these two said were realli offens in some of these other state anyon can bui a gun as long as he s breath oooooo we have some veri veri good gun law in massachusett if onli the other state would adopt the same type of law we wouldn t be have thi situat but thei won t naughti naughti next up wa boston citi councilman albert dapper o neill he wa there to testifi pro gun but in some wai he wa a liabil he s reason elderli and tend to wander and repeat himself plu he s almost a caricatur of a law n order politician he badmouth the aclu said violent crimin should be execut and that if he were judg he d give arreste their last right pun intend on the spot at which mani of the gun owner applaud which bother me he said that all the propos gun restrict were a step in the right direct for the crimin he said thi four time two of the bill under consider would allow polic to rescind a ccw or fid and confisc all your gun if someon had file a restrain order against you note that the file of a restrain order requir no warrant no hear no evid and no convict just an accus senat barrett of read testifi in favor of it and patron the pro gunner there sever time by sai i m sure all the gun owner here will agre with me that we have to get these weapon out of the hand of peopl that our court have convict i haven t seen such a disgustingli disingenu perform sinc nixon whine that he wasn t a crook barrett also spoke in favor of the bill make the fid card renew everi five year instead of perman as it is now the state purpos is to remov fid card from those who have becom inelig revenu ha noth to do with it yeah right appar some congressmen think we re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it s prefer to process 1 6 million renew everi cycl in the vagu hope of catch a recent felon than to simpli take the goddamn card awai from a crimin at convict time as usual hassl the law abid instead of the crook the two co chair of the committe were rep caron and sen jujuga jujuga didn t sai much he wa a co sponsor of both restrain order bill but caron struck me as a sharp gui that wouldn t let ani bad logic or li on the part of either side to go unchalleng he wa a co sponsor of on of the restrain order bill as well on of the younger rep on the committe forgot hi name wa vocifer pro gun somewhat embarrassingli so hi heart wa in the right place but hi argument seem to be confin to everi year it s the same damn thing you come in here with thi crap it s nice to have a friend on the committe but he could have been more effect at about 3 00 it wa clear that the hall jam couldn t continu someon came out of anoth meet hall and yell at the cop becaus the loudspeak wa disturb their meet so the loudspeak wa disconnect so thei found a bigger hall upstair on of us had to leav to catch hi charter bu and so miss the public testimoni the other got a seat thi time caron began by talk about how he got hi fid 16 year ago left the state and then return without notifi them of hi address chang he complain that the state record system wa not up to date and that hi pd back in hi citi of birth still thought he live there great quot if you purchas a gun todai it will not get into the state comput system until 1999 thi wa also an argument he us against the renew fid card testimoni wa heard from sever batter women on of whom had been attack by some gui in hi 20 s who had an fid card becaus he got it when he wa 15 or thereabout thei us a lot of emot and said how thei were scare of these men a staffer of attornei gener harshbarg testifi in favor of thi anti gun bill sai how 50 000 restrain order were grant last year and how these women need to be protect caron note that a restrain order wa grant for 10 dai and then a hear wa held to determin whether the order would be extend to a year he ask whether she would be satisfi if the fid were revok at the time of thi hear rather than after the initi issuanc of the fid she gave some long rambl circumlocut in respons then testimoni against the bill wa heard mike yacino who look someth like einstein got up and made the point that restrain order were issu on too littl evid that judg like to issu restrain order just to let thing cool off no matter who thei think is right man or woman and that the hear for restrain order ar lightn session with littl time to consid fact atti karen mcnutt spoke with him a few time dure hi testimoni other pro gunner got up to testifi on said he had had to file a restrain order against a tenant to clear her out and that she counter by file on against him he note that thi would have allow the state to confisc hi gun if the new bill becam law on of the junior rep note that thi is america and we have to be certain that individu right ar respect senat jujuga reiter thi sai that peopl who abus smaller peopl can go to hell as far as i care but we have to be care about equat convict with a restrain order point and match senat anoth pro gunner got up and testifi that he didn t know hi citizenship expir everi 5 year and that a driver s licens wa a privileg not a right like the right to keep and bear arm a third got up and said the problem wa with the crimin justic system and argu in favor of a death penalti bill and public hang senat jujuga said he had himself tri to get a death penalti bill pass and joke respond that he too favor public hang the speaker then respond i ll make you a deal you get me the rope and i ll tie the noos next came public testimoni on the simon s rock bill a teacher testifi that she had been the teacher of wayn lo and that he wouldn t have been abl to shoot peopl insid a build while he wa outsid without hi evil gun she said that the loophol should be close to prevent someth like thi from ever happen again four or five other kid testifi in favor of thi bill on of spill tear for the good legisl on of the student actual shot by wayn lo wa also there mani of them had t shirt on sai as long as on person can bui a gun in anger none of us ar safe support gun control the committe wa reluct to grill or correct the kid except for caron who correct on student who had claim that anyon could appli for an fid onli resid can get fid s he said how much do you want to bet that thi kid had no idea he had been con into testifi for a bill that would cut out of stater complet off yacino and mcnutt spoke again thi time note that the bill as written would affect both ammo and all gun possess by out of stater karen also note that hunter in ct nh and vt could be put awai for a year if thei wander across the ma boundari somewher in the wood and got challeng by game warden yacino underscor the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resid student and hell even an ccw as he had no crimin or mental record on junior rep wa upset that it would take ma resid longer to bui a gun than out of stater and thought it wa elitist anoth caron said that we need the protect of prevent non resid from bui without an fid becaus onli two other state in the union had fid type card so compli with all the law of on s home state wa not enough on pro gun speaker repli that thi resembl a mother watch her son in a march band and exclaim everyon s out of step but johnni all the bard colleg peopl were file out as the pro gun testimoni for thi bill wa made and thu onli pro gunner were around when the other bill came under consider the main bill remain and goal s posit were o h 4375 and four other notifi polic chief so thei can pull licens when a holder is convict strongli support o h 1732 requir trigger lock on all handgun sold oppos o h 962 requir trigger lock on all load firearm strongli oppos o h 1350 allow everi municip to enact their own gun law oppos o h 1731 fund bullet proof vest for municip polic support o s 1097 state constitut amend for the rkba support o sever on polic discret in the issuanc of fid card oppos o sever alter non resid licens condit support o h 1135 ban damn near all gun everywher in the state guess some of these took onli 30 second to consid as the remain pro gunner rais hand in unison either for or against them mike yacino note that besid the danger in screw with a trigger lock on a load gun that bill would make it illeg for a license to carri hi conceal handgun unless it were lock caron blew right through h 1350 when he saw that we oppos it again he brought up the state s archaic record capabl and said thi would creat hundr of differ licens system the session ran late sinc it wa the last schedul hear it could not be adjourn until everyon who want to had testifi it end at about 6 30 cdt rocket sw
