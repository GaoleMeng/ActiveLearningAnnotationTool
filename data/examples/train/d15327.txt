someon refer to my faq essai on homosexu sinc it hasn t been post for some time and i ve modifi it somewhat sinc the last time i m take thi opportun to post it there is anoth entri in the faq contain comment by some other contributor thei can be retriev from ftp rutger edu as pub soc religion christian other homosexu it contain far more detail on the exeget issu than i give here though primarili from a conserv point of view thi post summar sever issu involv homosexu and christian thi is a frequent ask question so i do not post the question each time it occur rather thi is an attempt to summar the post we get when we have a discuss it summar argument for allow christian homosexu sinc most peopl ask the question alreadi know the argument against it the most common but not the onli question dealt with herein is how can a christian justifi be a homosexu given what the bibl sai about it first on the definit of homosexu mani group believ that there is a homosexu orient i e a sexual attract to member of the same sex thi is distinguish from actual homosexu sexual activ homosexu who abstain from sex ar consid by most group to be accept howev in a lot of discuss the term homosexu mean someon actual engag in homosexu sex thi is gener not accept outsid the most liber group in thi paper i m go to us homosexu as mean a person engag in sexual act with anoth of the same sex i haven t heard of ani biblic argument against a person with homosexu orient who remain celeb i think most peopl now admit that there is a predisposit to be homosexu thi is often call a homosexu orient it is not known whether it is genet or environment there is evid suggest each the best evid i ve seen is that homosexu is not a singl phenomenon but ha a number of differ caus on of them is probabl genet there ar sever group that try to help peopl move from be homosexu to heterosexu the best known is exodu intern the report i ve seen and i haven t read the detail literatur just the summari in the minor opinion to the presbyterian church s infam report on human sexual suggest that these program have veri low success rate and that there ar question about how real even the success ar but there certainli ar peopl who sai thei have convert howev thi issu is not as import as it sound those who believ homosexu is wrong believ it is intrins wrong defin as such by god the fact that it s hard to get out of be a homosexu is no more relev than the fact that it s hard to escap from be a drug addict if it s wrong it s wrong it mai affect how we deal with peopl though if it s veri difficult to chang thi mai tend to make us more will to forgiv it on more gener background issu it s common to quot a figur that 10% of the popul is homosexu i ask on of our expert where thi came from here s hi respons kinsei see below is the sourc of the figur 10 percent he defin sexual by behavior not by orient and rank all person on a scale from zero complet heterosexu to 6 complet heterosexu accord to kinsei on third of all male adult have had at least on experi of orgasm homosexu post puberti ten percent of all adult male have most of their experi of homosexu that wa in 1948 the percentag held true in a followup studi done by the kinsei institut base on data in the earli seventi but not publish until the earli 80s or so by bell and weinberg i believ i can t put my hand on thi latter refer but here is the onlin inform for kinsei s own studi as it appear in iri the catalog at rutger author kinsei alfr charl 1894 1956 titl sexual behavior in the human male by alfr c kinsei wardel b

eugen joint author subject sex u s moral condit lc card 48005195 thi figur is wide us in all scholarli discuss and ha even been found to hold true in sever other cultur as note in the recent newsweek coverstori is thi child gai feb 24 1992 a journalist is run the round of talk show thi season promot her book that allegedli refut kinsei s studi but the scholarli world seem to take her for a kook i ve seen some object to the kinsei s studi but not in enough detail to includ here if someon would like to contribut anoth view i d be will to includ it most christian believ homosexu at least genit sex is wrong not all howev a few denomin accept it the metropolitan commun church is the best known it wa form specif to accept homosexu howev the unit church of christ also allow it and i think a coupl of other group mai as well the episcop church seem to accept it some area but not other in church that have congreg govern you ll find a few congreg that accept it even among southern baptist though the number is probabl onli on or two congreg but these ar unusu few church permit homosexu church leader how carefulli thei enforc thi is anoth issu i don t have ani doubt that there ar homosexu pastor of just about everi denomin some more open than other as to the argument over the biblic and other issu here s an attempt to summar the issu the most commonli cite refer by those favor accept of homosexu in previou discuss ha been john boswel christian social toler and homosexu u chicago press 1980 the argument against is pretti clear there ar sever explicit law in the ot e g leviticu 20 13 and in rom 1 paul seem pretti neg on homosexu beyond these refer there ar some debat some passag often cite on the subject probabl ar not relev e g the sin which the inhabit of sodom propos to carri out wa homosexu rape not homosexu activ between consent adult there s even some question whether it wa homosexu sinc the entiti involv were angel it wa particularli horrifi becaus it involv guest and the respons toward guest in that cultur wa veri strong thi is probabl the reason lot offer hi daughter it wa better to give up hi daughter than to allow hi guest to be attack if you look through a concord for refer to sodom elsewher in the bibl you ll see that few seem to impli that homosexu wa their sin there s a jewish interpret tradit that the major sin wa abus of guest at ani rate there s no debat that homosexu rape is wrong i do not discuss leviticu becaus the law there is part of a set of law that most christian do not consid bind so unless nt justif can be found lev alon would not settl the issu the nt refer ar all in paul s letter a number of the refer from paul ar list of sin in which the word ar fairli vagu boswel argu that the word occur in these list do not mean homosexu here s what he sai the two greek word that appear in the list i e i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 ar malako and arsenokoitai unfortun it is not entir clear what the word actual mean malako with a basic mean of soft ha a varieti of metaphor mean in ethic write boswel suggest wanton as a like equival he also report that the unanim interpret of the church includ greek speak christian wa that in thi passag it refer to masturb a mean that ha vanish onli in the 20th cent as that practic ha come to be less frown upon he cite refer as late as the 1967 edit of the cathol encyclopedia that identifi it as masturb he translat arsenokotai as male prostitut give evid that none of the church father understood the term as refer to homosexu in gener a more technic mean suggest by the earli latin translat would be activ mode homosexu male prostitut but in hi view paul did not intend it so technic for a more conserv view i consult gordon fee s commentari on i cor he cite evid that malako often meant effemin howev boswel warn us that in greek cultur effemin is not necessarili synonym with homosexu though it mai be associ with some kind of homosexu behavior given what boswel and fee sai taken togeth i suspect that the term is simpli not veri definit and that while it appli to homosexu in some case it isn t a gener term for homosexu while fee argu against boswel with arsenokotai as well he end up suggest a translat that seem essenti the same the big problem with it is that the word is almost never us paul s write is the first occur the fact that the word is clearli compos of male and f k unfortun doesn t quit tell us the mean sinc it doesn t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action exampl of compound word form either wai can be given in theori it could refer to rapist etc it s danger to base mean pure on etymolog or you ll conclud that goodby is a religi express becaus it s base on god by with ye howev sinc boswel fee and niv seem to agre on homosexu male prostitut that seem as good a guess as ani note that thi translat miss the strong vulgar of the term howev someth which fee and boswel agre on but do not attempt to reproduc in their translat in my opinion the strongest nt refer to homosexu is roman 1 boswel point out that rom 1 speak of homosexu as someth that happen to peopl who were natur heterosexu as a result of their corrupt due to worship fals god on could argu that thi is simpli an exampl that if a homosexu worship fals god he would also fall into degrad and perhap becom heterosexu howev i find thi argument somewhat forc and in fact our homosexu reader have not serious propos that thi is what paul meant howev i am not convinc that rom 1 is suffici to creat a law against homosexu for christian what paul is describ in rom 1 is not homosexu among christian it s homosexu that appear among idolat as on part of a whole packag of wicked despit the impress left by hi impass rhetor i m sure paul doe not believ that pagan complet abandon heterosexu sex given hi descript of their situat i rather assum that their heterosexu sex would also be debas and shameless so ye i do believ that thi passag indic a neg view of homosexu but in all fair the shameless natur of their act is a reflect of the gener spiritu state of the peopl and not a specif featur of homosexu my overal view of the situat is the follow i think we have enough evid to be confid that paul disapprov of homosexu rom 1 seem clear while i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 ar not unambigu and gener condemn of homosexu thei do not seem like word that would come from someon who approv of homosexu or even consid it accept in some case on the other hand none of these passag contain explicit teach on the subject rom 1 is realli about idolatri it refer to homosexu in pass the result of thi situat is that peopl interpret these passag in light of their gener approach to scriptur for those who look to scriptur for law about issu such as thi it not surpris that thei would consid these passag to be nt endors of the ot prohibit for those whose approach to the bibl is more liber it is not surpris that thei regard paul s neg view of homosexu as someth that he took from hi jewish upbring without ani seriou reexamin in the light of the gospel as reader of thi group know by now the assumpt behind these approach ar so radic differ that peopl tend to foam at the mouth when thei see the oppos view describ there s not a lot i can do as moder about such a situat a number of discuss in the past center around the sort of detail exegesi of text that is describ abov howev in fact i m not convinc that defend of homosexu actual base their own belief on such analys the real issu seem to rest on the question of whether paul s judgement should appli to modern homosexu on commonli made claim is that paul had simpli never face the kind of question we ar try to deal with he encount homosexu onli in context where most peopl would probabl agre that it wa wrong he had never face the experi of christian who try to act straight and fail and he had never face christian who ar try to defin a christian homosexu which fit with gener christian ideal of fidel and of see sexual as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexu among idolat and us it to make judgement on these question anoth is the follow in paul s time homosexu wa associ with a number of thing that christian would not find accept it wa part of templ prostitut among privat citizen it often occur between adult and children or free peopl and slave i m not in a posit to sai that it alwai did but there ar some reason to think so the ancient distinguish between the activ and passiv partner it wa consid disgrac for a free adult to act as the passiv partner thi is the reason that an activ mode homosexu prostitut would be consid disgrac hi custom would all be peopl who enjoi the passiv role thi support the idea that it would tend not to be engag in between two free adult male at least not without some degre of scandal clearli christian homosexu would not condon sex with children slave or other who ar not in a posit to be fulli respons partner howev fee s commentari on i cor cite some exampl from ancient literatur of homosexu relationship that do seem to involv free adult in a reason symmetr wai thu the consider in thi paragraph shouldn t be push too far homosexu mai have been discredit for jew by some of these associ but there sure must be been case that were not prostitut and did not involv slave or children some peopl have argu that aid is a judgement against homosexu i d like to point out that aid is transmit by promiscu sex both homosexu and heterosexu someon who ha a homosexu relationship that meet christian criteria for marriag is not at risk for aid note that there is good reason from paul s gener approach to doubt that he would conced homosexu as a fulli equal altern apart from ani specif statement on homosexu i believ hi us of the genesi stori would lead him to regard heterosexu marriag as what god ordain howev the wai paul deal with pastor question provid a warn against be too quick to deal with thi issu legal i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexu christian is not entir a theolog issu but also a pastor on paul s tendenc as we can see in issu such as eat meat and celebr holidai is to be uncompromis on principl but in pastor issu to look veri carefulli at the good of the peopl involv and to avoid insist on perfect when it would be person damag for exampl while paul clearli believ that it wa accept to eat meat he want us to avoid push peopl into do an action about which thei had person qualm for anoth exampl paul obvious would have prefer to see peopl at least in some circumst remain unmarri yet if thei were unabl to do so he certainli would rather see them marri than in a state where thei might be tempt to fornic i believ on could take a view like thi even while accept the view paul express in rom 1 on mai believ that homosexu is not what god intend that it occur as a result of sin but still conclud that at time we have to live with it note that in the creation stori work enter human life as a result of sin thi doesn t mean that christian can stop work when we ar save the question is whether you believ that homosexu is in itself sin or whether you believ that it s a misfortun that is in a broad sens due to human sin if you re will to consid the latter approach then it becom a pastor judgement whether there is more damag caus by find a wai to live with it or try to cure it the danger of try to cure it ar that the attempt most often fail and when it doe you end up with damag rang from psycholog damag to suicid as well as broken marriag when attempt at live as a heterosexu fail thi is go to depend upon on s assess of the inher natur of homosexu if you believ it is a veri seriou wrong then you mai be will to run high risk of seriou damag to get rid of it clearli we do not gener suggest that peopl live with a tendenc to steal or with drug addict even though attempt to cure these condit ar also veri difficult howev these condit ar intrins damag in a wai that is not so obviou for homosexu mani problem associ with homosexu ar actual problem of promiscu not homosexu thi includ aid i take for grant that the onli sort of homosexu relationship a christian would consid allow would be equival to christian heterosexu relationship in the cours of discuss thi over the last decad or so we ve heard a lot of person testimoni from fellow christian who ar in thi situat i ve also seen summari of variou research and the result of variou effort for convers asid from the presbyterian report mention abov there s an faq that summar our reader report on thi question the evid is that long term success in chang orient is rare enough to be on a par with heal miracl the danger in advis christian to depend upon such a chang is clear when convers doesn t happen which is almost alwai the peopl ar often left in despair feel exclud from a church that ha noth more to sai but a requir of life long celibaci paul recogn though in a differ context that such a demand is not practic for most peopl and i think the histori of cleric celibaci ha strongli reinforc that judgement the practic result is that homosexu end up in the gai sex club and the rest of the sordid side of homosexu mayb homosexu isn t god s origin ideal but i can well imagin paul prefer to see peopl in long term commit christian relationship than promiscu as with work which genesi suggest wasn t part of god s origin ideal either i think such relationship can still be a vehicl for peopl share god s love with each other there s an issu of biblic interpret underli thi discuss the issu is that of cultur relativ that is when paul sai that someth is wrong should thi be taken as an etern statement or ar thing wrong becaus of specif situat in the cultur of the time conserv christian gener insist on take prohibit as absolut sinc otherwis the bibl becom subject what is to stop us from consid everyth in it as rel when look at thi issu it s worth note that no on complet reject the concept of cultur relativ there ar a number of judgement in the new testament that even conserv christian consid to be rel the follow judgement ar at least as clear in the bibl as anyth said on homosexu prohibit against charg interest thi occur 18 time in the ot it s not in the nt but i mention it here becaus until rel recent the church did consid it bind on christian prohibit against swear oath endors of slaveri as an institut judgement of tax collector as sinner we do not regard these item as bind in most case i believ the argument is essenti on of cultur relativ briefli prohibit of interest is appropri to a specif agrarian societi that the bibl wa try to build but not to our market economi few peopl believ that american judici oath have the same characterist as the kind of oath jesu wa concern about most peopl believ that paul wa simpli tell peopl how to live within slaveri but not endors it as an institut for peopl believ that the ir is moral equival to roman tax farm the point i m try to make is that befor appli biblic prohibit to the 20th cent we need to look at whether the 20th cent action ar the same when christian homosexu sai that their relationship ar differ than the greek homosexu that paul would have been familiar with thi is exactli the same kind of argument that is be made about judici oath and tax collector until fairli recent christian prohibit take of interest and mani christian regard slaveri as divin endors inde slaveri is on of the more common metaphor for the relationship between god and human be christian ar often call servant or slave of god i am not try to sai that everyth in the bibl is cultur rel rather i m try to sai that some thing ar and therefor it is not enough to sai that becaus someth appear in the bibl that end the discuss we need to look at whether the action we re talk about now ha the same moral implic as the on that the bibl wa talk about if christian want to argu that there ar reason to think that the prohibit against homosexu ar still bind i m will to listen those who claim that the question doesn t need to be look at ar kid themselv unless thei ar part of the small minor who realli obei all the rule list abov on thing that worri me is the great emot that thi issu creat when you consid the weak of the biblic evid some law in leviticu a passag in rom whose subject matter is realli idolatri rather than homosexu and a coupl of list whose word ar ambigu the amount of concern thi is rais among christian seem rather out of proport thi should suggest to peopl that there ar reason other than simpli biblic involv thi is true on both side clearli homosexu christian ar as strongli motiv to find wai of discredit the biblic argument as conserv christian ar to find biblic argument but i can t help feel that the bibl is be us by both side as a wai of justifi attitud which come from other sourc thi is a danger situat for christian on the other side of the issu i would like to note some problem i have with the pro homosexu posit as it is commonli present on of the most common argument is that homosexu is biolog determin i e god made me homosexu and i have no choic i think god made me homosexu is a fine view for peopl who alreadi believ on other ground that homosexu is accept but i don t see it as an argument for accept mani peopl think that alchol is larg biolog and drug addict mai turn out to be as well that doesn t mean it s ok most of us have particular thing we tend to do wrong some peopl get angri easili other tend to be arrog other tend to be attrac to women who ar marri to someon els homosexu if we view it as wrong wouldn t be differ than ani of these other thing if we ar go to follow god we all end up at on time or anoth have to work to overcom bad habit and particular temptat that caus us problem none of us can sit back and sai that becaus god made us the wai we ar we can just relax as jesu said we all have to take up our cross daili thi concept of dy to self which also appear throughout paul s letter seem to suggest that there ar go to be thing about ourselv that we we ar call on not to accept paul s letter and the experi of christian throughout histori show us that sin is ingrain in us and the battl against it is lifelong and difficult the fact that homosexu is difficult to fight doesn t necessarili sai it s ok mayb thi isn t the place where we have to die to self but i d like to make sure that those who think it isn t ar fight the battl somewher els and not reject the concept that all christian have to fight against the deepli engrain habit of sin
