i have an idea as to why the encrypt algorithm need to be keep secret and some thing that i think it impli of cours these could all be wrong from the clipper chip a technic summari dorothi den revis april 21 1993 the clipper chip contain a classifi singl kei 64 bit block encrypt algorithm call skipjack the algorithm us 80 bit kei compar with 56 for the de and ha 32 round of scrambl compar with 16 for the de it support all 4 de mode of oper the algorithm take 32 clock tick and in electron codebook ecb mode run at 12 mbit per second each chip includ the follow compon the skipjack encrypt algorithm f an 80 bit famili kei that is common to all chip n a 30 bit serial number thi length is subject to chang u an 80 bit secret kei that unlock all messag encrypt with the chip encrypt with the chip to see how the chip is us imagin that it is embed in the at t telephon secur devic as it will be suppos i call someon and we both have such a devic after push a button to start a secur convers my secur devic will negoti an 80 bit session kei k with the devic at the other end thi kei negoti take place without the clipper chip in gener ani method of kei exchang can be us such as the diffi hellman public kei distribut method onc the session kei k is establish the clipper chip is us to encrypt the convers or messag stream m digit voic the telephon secur devic feed k and m into the chip to produc two valu e m k the encrypt messag stream and e e k u n f a law enforc field which ar transmit over the telephon line the law enforc field thu contain the session kei k encrypt under the unit kei u concaten with the serial number n all encrypt under the famili kei f the law enforc field is decrypt by law enforc after an author wiretap ha been instal suppos i knew how the algorithm work and knew the n for my chip but did not know f then by cryptanalysi i might be abl to determin f from if law enforc field e e k u n f not know n would might make thi much harder now suppos that i know f either legitim or not if i know k either becaus i am involv in the convers or i know u for a parti in the convers i mai now be abl to determin u for the other parti if i know f i can also defeat the law enforc field sinc i could make my own with a differ k then the on i am us know f also allow traffic analysi to be perform so i might not know what you ar sai but i could know who you ar sai it too now i admit that someon try to comput u will not have lot of messag to work from but sinc we have no wai of know that the kei gener method doe not deliber gener weak kei or for that matter that the publish method is in fact us perhap the u s will be chosen from know weak kei for the system obvious the compromis of f would be a disast both to law enforc for whom thi whole thing is design and for the peopl who believ that it is give them secur f is but on number and i sure that alot of peopl more then 1 know what it is and if some panel of expert is go to check it over for flaw then mani more will know f forget grind chip briberi and blackmail work just fine so am i wrong or ar these problem jon
