larri l overack write respond to simon i mai be interest to see some brief select post to the net my understand is that sspx doe not consid itself in schism or legitim excommun but that s realli besid the point what doe the roman cathol church sai excommun can be real apart from formal excommun as provid for in canon law here s some of the theologi involv for the interest there is confus over thi issu of the sspx s schism often the basic problem is lack of an abil to distinguish between true obedi fals obedi disobedi schism take the variou classif of obedi first there ar 2 import element involv here for my purpos 1 a command 2 the respons made to the command as far as the command goe command can be legitim such as the pope order cathol to not eat meat on fridai or thei can be illegitim such as the pope order cathol to worship the god dagon when everi other full moon come around as far as the respons to a command goe it can be to refus to do what is command or to compli make a tabl there ar thu 4 possibilit command respons name legitim compli true obedi illegitim refus true obedi legitim refus disobedi illegitim compli fals obedi so now you see where my 3 classif of obedi come from obedi is not sole a matter of complianc refus the natur of the command must also be taken into account it is not enough to consid someon s complianc or refus and then sai whether thei ar obedi or disobedi you also have to take into consider whether the command ar good or bad in my exampl if the pope command all cathol to worship the god dagon and thei all refus thei aren t be disobedi at all as far as the societi of saint piu x goe thei ar certainli refus to compli with certain thing the pope desir but that alon is insuffici to allow on to label them disobedi you also have to consid the natur of the papal desir and there s the rub sspx sai the pope sinc vatican ii have been command certain veri bad thing for the church the pope have of cours disagre so where ar we ar we in anoth arian heresi complet with weak pope or ar the sspx priest modern martin luther well the onli wai to answer that is to examin who is sai what and what the tradit teach of the church is the problem here is that veri few cathol have much of an idea of what is realli go on and what the issu ar the religion of american cathol is especi defect in intellectu depth you will never read about the issu be discuss in the cathol press in thi countri on the other hand on italian cathol magazin i get 30 dai ha had interview with the superior gener of the societi of saint piu x mani cathol will decid to side with the pope there is some sound in thi becaus the papaci is infal so eventu some pope will straighten all thi out but on the other hand there is also unsound in thi in that in the short term the pope mai inde be wrong and such cathol ar do noth to help the situat by obei them where thei re wrong in fact if the situat is grave enough thei sin in obei him at the veri least thei re wast a great opportun becaus thei ar fail to love christ in a heroic wai at the veri time that he need thi badli schism let s move on to schism what is it schism is a superset of disobedi refus to obei a legitim command all schismat ar disobedi but it s a superset so it doesn t work the other wai around not all disobey ar schismat the mere fact that the sspx priest don t compli with the holi father s desir doesn t make them schismat so what is it that must be ad to disobedi to constitut a schism mayb thi someth els make the sspx priest schismat you must add thi the reject of the right to command look in ani decent refer on cathol theologi and that s what you ll find the distinguish criterion of schism is reject of the right to command here s what the cathol encyclopedia sai for exampl not everi disobedi is a schism in order to possess thi charact it must includ besid the trangress of the command of superior denial of their divin right to command from the ce articl schism is the societi of saint piu x then schismat the answer is a clear no thei sai that the pope is their boss thei prai for him everi dai and that s all that matter as far as schism goe what all thi boil down to is thi if we leav asid the consider of the exact natur of their object their posit is a legitim on as far as the cathol theologi of obedi and schism goe thei ar resist certain papal polici becaus thei think that thei ar clearli contrari to the tradit teach of the papaci and the best interest of the church in fact someon who find himself in thi situat ha a duti to resist now what is the stanc of rome on all thi well if you read the holi father s motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out it s the definit document on the subject a motu proprio is a specif papal act it s not the product of a roman congreg a letter that the pope ha possibl never even read it s from the pope himself hi boss is god there s no on els to complain to in thi document the holi father sai among other thing 1 the episcop consecr perform by archbishop lefebvr constitut a schismat act 2 archbishop lefebvr s problem wa a misunderstand of the natur of tradtion both ar confus i fail to see the logic of the pope s point as far as the episcop consecr go i read an interest articl in a translat of the italian magazin si si no no it all get back to the question of jurisdict if episcop consecr impli reject of the pope s jurisdict then thei would truli constitut a schismat act justifi excommun under the current code of canon law but my problem with thi is thi accord to the tradit theologi of holi order episcop consecr doe not confer jurisdict it onli confer the power of order the abil to confect the sacrament jurisdict must be confer by someon els with the power to confer it such as the pope the societi bishop know the tradit theologi quit well take great pain to avoid ani pretenc of jurisdict over anyon thei simpli confer those sacrament that requir a bishop the si si no no articl wa interest in that it posit that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he ha a novel post vatican ii idea of holi order accord to thi idea episcop consecr doe confer jurisdict i lent the articl to a friend unfortun so can t tell you more i believ thei quot the new code of canon law in support of thi idea the pope s think on thi point remain a great puzzl to me there s no wai there is a schism accord to tradit cathol theologi so why doe the pope think thi as far as the point regard the natur of tradit goe here s the passag in question the root of thi schismat act can be discern in an incomplet and contradictori notion of tradtion incomplet becaus it doe not take suffici into the account the live charact of tradit which as the second vatican council clearli taught come from the apostl and progress in the church with the help of the holi spirit there is a growth in insight into the realiti and word that ar be pass on thi come about in variou wai it come through the contempl and studi of believ who ponder these thing in their heart it come from the intim sens of spiritu realiti which thei experi and it come from the preach of those who have receiv along with their right of success in the espiscop the sure charism of truth but especi contradictori is a notion of tradit which oppos the univers magisterium of the church possess by the bishop of rome and the bodi of bishop it is imposs to remain faith to the tradit while break the ecclesi bond with him to whom in the person of the apostl peter christ himself entrust the ministri of uniti in hi church papal motu proprio ecclesia dei 2 juli 1988 it seem to me that the holi father is make two point here that can be simplifi to the follow vatican council ii ha happen i am the pope the argument be that either case is suffici to prove that archbishop lefebvr must be wrong becaus he disagre with them thi is weak to sai the least it would have help clarifi thing more if the pope had address archbishop lefebvr s concern in detail what is john paul ii s stand on the social kingship of christ as taught by gregori xvi piu ix leo xiii piu xi and piu xii for exampl ar we suppos to ignor what all these pope said on the subject i don t know what the futur will hold but the power that be in the sspx ar still talk with rome and try to straighten thing out mani peopl would prefer to call a justifi refus to obei justifi disobedi or even obei god rather than man call a refus to obei obedi put us into a sort of alic in wonderland world where word mean whatev we want them to mean similarli schism indic a formal break in the church if the pope sai that a schism exist it seem to me that by definit it exist it mai be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortli be heal but how can on deni that it doe in fact exist it seem to me that you ar in grave danger of destroi the thing you ar try to reform the power of the papaci what good will it do you if you becom reconcil to the the pope in the futur but in the process you have destroi hi abil to us the tool of church disciplin it s on thing to hold that the pope ha misus hi power and excommun someon wrongli it s someth els to sai that hi excommun did not take effect and the schism is all in hi imagin that mean that act of church disciplin ar not legal tool but act whose valid is open to debat gener it ha been liber cathol who have had problem with the pope while thei have often object to church sanction gener thei have admit that the sanction exist you ar now open the door to peopl simpli ignor papal decis claim to be truli obei by disobei and to be in communion while excommun thi would seem to be precis the denial of divin right to command that you sai defin schism clh
