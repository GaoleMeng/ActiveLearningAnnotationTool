on not so quick question to throw out there for you gui for our class project we need to design and build a power suppli to the follow spec voltatg adjust from 1 12v current limit at 1a voltag must stai within 2% of design valu for i from 0 1a ac rippl less than 5 mv rm of cours we can t just us an adjust voltag current limit regul chip our problem is with the current limit i e we ve found stuff to do the rest of the part of the circuit what the suppli must do if present with a load which would draw more than 1a given the suppli voltag is reduc the voltag so that the current will equal on amp thu if we were to short the thing with the ammet we should read on amp if we measur the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12v we should read on amp and the output voltag by necess must be 1v the onli basic idea we have seen for the current limit involv a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefor reduc the output so doe anybodi have ani idea we could work from thank in advanc andi collin kc6yei acollin uclink berkelei edu ps if anybodi want to flame thi as a stupid project i agre fulli but i still have to do it it grade
