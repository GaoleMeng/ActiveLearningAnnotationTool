mv104 psuvm psu edu write mani peopl would probabl think especi if the fanat propogand thi that thi wa a conflict between the atheist and the religi mani would get the impress that we were try to outlaw religion if we contintu to try to remov all thing with a religi refer that s not what the peopl i ve ask think perhap you would be right if you said the fundamentalist would think thi wai after all thei think thei ar be oppress when thei ar not allow to oppress howev you have not shown where you get thi idea that mani peopl would probabl think it s atheism vs religion winner take all as far as i can tell it is your groundless predict that thi will happen but you haven t taken into the account of propoganda rememb if you ask german befor wwii if the jew shoudl be slaughter thei would probabl answer no but after the propoganda machin roll through at least some were abl to toler it you see it onli take a small group of fanat to whip up a gener frenzi the propoganda machin have been in gear over a number of issu includ abort and gai look at some of the thing that have happen well so far thei have pass on amend which is current under intens scrutini and thei have fail to outlaw abort which is their prime goal on that issu yep thei seem sooo effect sure well thei haven t manag to outlaw abort due to the possibl object of the court but thei have manag to creat quit a few problem for peopl that want to have an abort thei could creat similar problem for us and it could be wors thei can try to stop abort by block clinic etc but imagin what thei d have to do to stop atheism besid the margin of error is veri larg when you onli talk to two peopl better than your on that is your opinion also i have branch out and the inform survei is up over half a dozen now and what have thei said were you question unbias keith you would claim that my question ar bias the minut i post them becaus the answer agre with me everyon i have ask about the possibl remov of the motto the christian portion ha express regret about it loss becaus thei like it howev when it is point out to them that a new motto will not be in the work none have express the desir to rape murder pillag etc which you have basic claim so you ar abl to convinc them individu but could you convinc a whole room of them a whole nation as for the atheist portion i know some around here thei have all express disgust with the motto some note be harass by christian who us the motto to try to seem justifi and all would see it gone ye i d be glad if it were gone to i ve never support it howev i think that it is a minor problem that can be easili ignor contrast with what could happen an what mai be like which christian design the motto doe the motto sai anyth about jesu why do you think that it refer onli to christian christian wrote it christian think that their religion is right and all other ar wrong therefor why would thei includ other religion in the realm of be correct i doubt that ani other religion were meant to be includ well i am not clear on the religi convict of franci scott kei the motto can be attribut to him but it is at least clear that he believ in a god and sure there ar a few christian that think as you sai but i don t think that most do do you think that all christian activ despis other religion most that i have met haven t and don t do so no christian that i have queri think it mean anyth but them and onli them why not ask some peopl of other faith sorri i would but christian is just so awfulli popular around here suppos you could ask a few peopl well i have ask a hindu moselem and a few jew and all of them think that it is applic to them of cours i can t sai that these peopl just some that i know pretti well ar accur represent of their faith it is alwai a good idea to assum that there were dissent view on ani given issu you ar assum that all the view were the same and noth lead to thi conclus without evid to the contrari i doubt that there were dissent opinion you claim there were provid some evid for your assert well i d realli like to and i ve tri but i realli don t know where to get access to _congression record_ from the 1950 s can anyon help out here compar christian to nazi interest onli in the sens that neither can probabl convinc to chang their belief no again the motto on the monei doesn t cost you anyth extra howev if you abolish the motto we d all have to pai to have all the di and plate redon like peopl paid befor to get them chang to have the motto on them you now need to show that there is a good reason to chang everyth again also i doubt that thei us th3 same plate for more than a year s print thi would make it easi to remov the motto simpli make next year s plate without it your claim evid is that thei will have to pai extra somewher provid some evid for thi assert so ar you sai that thei redesign the plate each year anywai your whole argument conveni delet i see wa that the motto somehow cost us all a lot of monei thi is just not correct the on i read didn t mention anyth about jesu i think the issu wa concern the distinct between religion and not how could it be between religi and not religi the motto refer to god it is a religi motto the question is whether or not it is onli christian you sai it is more i doubt thi provid some evid for thi assert that is to sai the religion of thi countri and the non religion of the ussr that wa what most of those quot were about and some includ all atheist in gener as well i don t think that ani of the quot although i seem to have lost them mention anyth at all about jesu thei advoc religion over non religion a specif religion wa not mention you have miss thi point i said that the motto didn t sai anyth about anyon in particular that is the motto doesn t impli anyth about your particular belief it doesn t sai that everyon trust in some form of god onli that the nation on the whole doe we have been through thi befor it s obviou it doe not includ me thi much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refer to more than christian base on the fact that christian sai all other religion ar wrong and becaus it seem that the motto wa written by christian i doubt your claim so you ar sai that all christian must believ that all other religion should be outlaw just becaus thei think thei ar wrong that s silli i think the flat earther ar wrong but i don t advoc their banish base on thi idea i doubt that ani addit expens would even be incur by remov the motto provid some evid for your claim that it would i think that ani such cost would be insignific i mention the slight cost becaus you said that the motto wa cost us a lot of monei by be on our currenc disregard the digress of the other motto if it is us for harass and no other purpos ha been found for it why should it not be remov well motto in gener don t realli have purpos i don t think it should be remov becaus i think the benefit would be outweigh by the consequ and do you know what the vote wa were there other opinion do you think that the main reason the motto wa requir by law wa to bother atheist do you think that thi is what the major of congress at the time had in mind if you do then show why again it is the opinion of the peopl who put it there that i am concern with then you should be concern with the opinion of the entir congress again it is not necessari that the complet major share the purpos of confront godless commun with thi motto why not it is the major that put it there the gener public probabl doe not know about the anti atheist intent of a few peopl in the 50 s either i daresai more peopl rememb the 50 s than the time when kei wrote the anthem but do thei rememb the debat surround the motto do thei rememb that some peopl intend it to be a messag against atheist why don t you includ thi in your littl survei that you were conduct you claim here that scientist would believ someon s claim i doubt thi provid evid for your assert what should i ask some scientist the probabl that someth einstein said about rel is worthi i mean if einstein said it there s a good chanc that it wa right at least at the time as for the court the method scientist us can be appli i need not agre with the court by default becaus of a good record you need not agre with them all of the time but you would certainli think that their decis would be good evid in favor of some point what but you said you didn t agre with the court becaus thei allow congress to attempt to make an amend prohibit flag burn if you don t realiz that someth like thi is extern to the realm of the court s power then how can i be confid that you know anyth about the court s power i mean if you don t know how the court work how can you particip in a discuss of the court a judg can go to speak befor congress and still you ignor the abort gag rule as you make your claim on abort no i think that it would be clearli inappropri for a suprem court justic to testifi befor congress dure the consider of a constitut amend and in order for the court to rule on someth a case usual must be present mushroom flower tree build sign whatev the analog is the same just becaus someth that i might find offens is present doesn t mean that my right ar be violat we ar talk about someth put there by peopl keith not a mushroom no on caus that mushroom to exist unless you re find thing offens in a mushroom farm ye some mushroom can be plant and i don t appreci mushroom on my pizza either thi is not the case with the motto and you re ignor the harass which is the onli known result of the motto and you re ignor that somewher along the line peopl were forc to put the motto there who wa forc to put the motto there what do you mean keith
