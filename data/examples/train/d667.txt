archiv name rec auto part5 thi articl is on of a pair of articl contain commonli ask automot question the other articl contain question more gear to the automot enthusiast and so is not crosspost to misc consum rpw chang as of 14 april 1993 revis brake fluid section as non silicon dot 5 fluid ar now appar avail rpw commonli ask automot question tire question q what do the funni number on the side of my tire mean a typic you will see someth like 195 60hr14 the 195 is the overal width of the tire in millimet the tread is usual narrow the 60 is the aspect ratio it indic the height of the sidewal of the tire rel to the overal width our exampl tire ha a sidewal height of 0 60 195 117 mm the 14 is the wheel diamet in inch there ar also some special tire call trx tire which have three digit metric wheel diamet design like 390 which is in millimet the r mean radial and the h is a speed rate indic the highest speed at which the tire when properli inflat and carri an appropri load mai safe oper common speed rate ar s 112mph t 118mph h 130mph and v up to 150mph recent chang to the method for specifi tire size move the speed rate to a differ part of the design you mai therefor find design like 195 60r14 85h the 85 indic the per tire load associ with the speed rate exceed thi load in continu oper at the rate speed is danger practic what follow is a tabl show a number of load indic and correspond maximum per tire load load index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 max load kg 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 note that the usual mass vs weight confus occur in thi tabl in some case the letter p or lt mai be found in front of a tire size the lt design indic light truck and the p design indic passeng car if no letter is given then the applic of the tire is passeng car usag as far as i know these letter onli appear in the us market the lt design is prinicip of interest to owner of light truck and other util vehicl for the owner of a passeng vehicl there is no meaning differ between a tire with a p design and on with no design at all if the aspect ratio is omit it is probabl 80 but mai be 78 tire with an ms mud snow design mai have their speed rate reduc by 20 km h about 12mph there is an addit set of rate on tire for temperatur traction and treadwear temperatur and traction ar grade a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numer rate these valu ar of limit valu as thei ar assign somewhat arbitrarili by tire manufactur and ar thu not us in compar differ brand of tire q my car ha tire with a funni size design 185 65hr390 can i put normal tire on the car a your tire ar call trx tire thei were devis by michelin becaus of a somewhat differ bead design thei ar incompat with normal tire michelin us a differ diamet wheel for them so that thei could not be mount on the wrong type wheel and so that more convent tire could not be mount on trx type wheel you will need to aquir differ wheel to put a normal tire on your car it is bare possibl to fit normal tire on trx wheel and horribl danger to do so the tire mai simpli peel off the rim in a corner or possibl blow out at high speed trx type tire ar becom hard to find in addit to michelin avon make suitabl tire goodyear ha appar discontinu their line of trx tire q can i rotat radial from side to side or rotat them onli on on side of my car a car and tire manufactur have differ view on thi subject mani sai that swap radial between the left and right hand side of a car is now ok thi group includ michelin and goodyear other for exampl pirelli and nokia will void warranti if such swap is done the best advic is to read your tire manual carefulli befor rotat your tire and stick to the manufactur s recommend q how mani snow tire should i bui and if i bui 2 which end of the car should i put them on a in short 4 and both end to explain mani driver in area that don t get excess snow or who don t drive agress or at all in snow condit get awai with onli two snow on the drive wheel but there ar circumst where thi can be danger practic with a rear wheel drive car you can choos between be abl to start the car go a function of the rear axl or stop and turn the car a function of the front axl in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primari risk of put the snow tire on the front onli is that if you have to put on the brake while go downhil you run a seriou risk of go downhil backward radar detector and speed limit q why aren t there ani comment on radar detector and speed limit in thi q a post a becaus question about detector and speed limit crosspost between misc consum and rec auto alwai start long tediou and pointless flame war if you want to talk about either of these topic pleas subscrib to rec auto or alt flame and keep it there safeti equip q do airbag realli work a preliminari statist suggest the follow airbag work much better than no belt good 3 point belt alon work much better than airbag alon and airbag 3 point belt work slightli better than 3 point belt alon the con to airbag is that some design tend to burn the driver s hand when vent the byproduct of the explos that occur insid the bag and that some design but not all mai knock the driver s hand from the wheel make retent of control of the vehicl after the bag deflat more difficult brake question q do i alwai need to get the rotor on my disk brake turn mida alwai want to do thi a no there ar specif condit that mandat turn or replac rotor some shop try and make a littl extra monei by replac rotor more often than is strictli necessari if the rotor ar not warp warp and onli lightli groov then there is no need to replac or to turn them note also that some rotor the rotor on mani honda ar a good exampl ar so narrow to begin with that it is not practic to turn them thei must be replac when thei becom too thin warp or badli groov q thei tell me i should downshift when brake to slow my car down is thi realli a good idea a it us to be a veri good idea back in the dai of mediocr fade prone drum brake in modern disc brake equip car us of downshift to slow the car is not realli necessari except in case of long steep downhil run otherwis modern disc brake ar more than adequ to stop a passeng car in all circumst and thei ar much cheaper to repair than clutch line on the other hand mani standard driver s licens test in the usa still specifi that the driver be test downshift under brake i suggest that befor take a us driver s test you either 1 learn to do thi smoothli which take some time and practic or 2 borrow a car with an automat to take the test q how often should i replac my brake fluid a probabl more often than you do tradit brake fluid tend to absorb water thi water can corrod intern part of the brake system and also lower the boil point of the fluid dot 3 type ar older fluid dot 4 and dot 5 ar newer specif the princip differ ar in wet and dry boil point the dry boil point is import in fresh brake fluid but the wet boil point is import in older brake fluid dot 3 fluid have the lowest wet and dry boil point _requir_ dot 4 fluid have better boil point requir and dot 5 fluid have the best boil point requir but dot 5 fluid ar not clearli superior see the next q a for more detail while the requir impli that dot 4 fluid ar better than dot 3 fluid there mai be specif case where a dot 3 fluid is prefer but these ar mostli competit applic otherwis dot 4 type fluid offer _much_ improv brake pedal feel replac onc a year is recommend for dot 4 fluid although agress driver mai profit by chang out fluid more frequent or at least bleed a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calip fairli regularli q what about dot 5 brake fluid a thi break down in to two part the dot 5 specif look excel for perform but the first dot 5 fluid were silicon base silicon fluid ar a tricki proposit unlik dot 3 and dot 4 fluid thei do not absorb water at all while thi mai sound like a featur the problem is that ani water present pool up in such system interf with brake perform and corrod ani metal at the spot where the pool is occur the water will tend to migrat downward in the brake system to the brake calip where most of the corros occur becaus of thi phenomenon it is essenti when convert to silicon to empti the entir brake system and flush it throughli beforehand some even recommend replac all rubber part in the brake system when convert to silicon fluid two other issu that come up with silicon fluid 1 thei ar difficult to pour cleanli that is without air bubbl which interfer with get a good brake pedal feel and 2 while thei gener have much higher boil point than dot 4 fluid thei do have high temperatur failur mode which ar indistinguish in effect from boil dot 4 fluid silicon fluid mai make sens in some street car applic but thei ar certainli not recommend for high perform drive applic and the econom ar question for street us i have recent becom awar of new fluid that meet the dot 5 standard that do not contain silicon these fluid appear to be reason compat with the older dot 3 and dot 4 fluid but i have littl inform at thi time q ab is avail on some of the car i m look at but it cost more is it worth it a thi doe not have a cut and dri answer therefor thi answer will be quit long in order to cover the pro and con the short answer is that ab cost more both initi and to maintain will gener work better for the averag driver that is to sai a driver who doe not have extens experi in high perform drive techniqu and mai requir the unlearn of some obsolet brake techniqu like pump brake which should be unlearn in ani case now for the long answer ab work by monit the wheel of the car look for sign of lock brake it mai or mai not be abl be abl to distinguish between the differ wheel there ar sever system on the market it cannot detect impend lockup which is what you would realli want in an ideal world but onli the exist of lockup the sensor us vari some of the less well design sensor ar sensit to tire size and to brake pad materi and mai ceas to function properli if the owner deviat from origin equip or oe equival compon when the sensor detect lockup the ab system respond by unlock the brake either individu or all at onc depend on the system if the driver keep their foot firmli plant the ab will end up cycl between the lock and unlock state if a sensor exist that could detect _impend lockup_ then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum brake effect is achiev thi puls can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycl the percentag of the time that the brake ar truli engag is call the duti cycl typic in an ab system thi is about 40% on dry pavement a train driver can beat thi duti cycl quit reliabl us a techniqu call threshold brake on wet pavement brake is so chanci that ab will outperform threshold brake nearli everi time unfortun on mud and on snow often maximum brake effect can be acheiv with the brake lock onli audi of the manufactur produc ab equip car ha seen fit to provid a disabl switch for the ab system for thi eventu a particularli import featur of ab is that it preserv steer control thi is the case simpli becaus if you ar brake near the limit and turn the wheel the ab will releas the brake if it see steer trigger lockup and back off on the percentag of the time that the brake ar appli brake distanc will lengthen accordingli an import caution ab cannot exce the maximum theoret brake forc in ani given situat if you start slide on glare ic don t expect an ab system to help you out veri much the coeffici of friction is not chang by the presenc of an ab system in your car as far as mainten goe in addit to the potenti restrict i ve list abov you have to worri about the follow 1 part cost ar much higher the oe master cylind for my obscur european sedan list for $185 but the oe master cylind for the ab equip version of the same car list for over $1000 most manufactur explicitli forbid us of dot 5 silicon brake fluid in ab equip vehicl becaus of the potenti cost of replac of corrod brake system compon regular i suggest annual replac of brake fluid becom veri import q what about thi threshold brake busi a normal i d not put thi in the consum q a but recent public about a number of accid involv polic driver in ab equip chevi capric suggest that thi section is need here rpw threshold brake is a techniqu practic by all seriou high perform driver if made a habit it replac the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entir and is much to be prefer basic the premis is that tire gener maximum brake forc when thei have just start to slide but just befor the wheel lock up entir driver who threshold brake learn to feel what thi threshold feel like and learn to search for it and hit it on the applic of the brake pedal in mani car you can feel that you ar near the threshold when the pedal start to firm up as you depress it in ani case if you can t hear the tire whine just a bit you re not veri near the threshold in a car with ab often there is a twing in the pedal just befor the system start cycl if the driver back off on the pedal just a tad when the twing is felt then thei ar veri close to the threshold and thei ll probabl achiev better stop distanc than if thei just punch it and let the ab take over recent there ha been a rash of public over a number of accid and on death involv polic car equip with ab system the polic depart in question quickli blame the new ab system but accord to autoweek magazin it now seem clear that the problem wa a lack of train none of the involv offic had ani recent perform drive train there is reason to believ that the driver react to the puls brake pedal by pump brake an old and discredit techniqu of stab and releas the brake pedal the goal be to try and get brake back with a fail hydraul system if you think about it for a minut you ll realiz that pump brake must cut the effect oper of a work brake system by at least 1 2 so if you cut the 40% duti cycl of an ab system by that much you ar give up most of your brake for the wrong reason threshold brake ha the advantag in that it is an effect and us techniqu regardless of whether your car ha ab if you do fear a fail hydraul system then on or two stab at the pedal will be suffici ga question q doe high octan gasolin help a mayb mayb not some car have knock sensor and can adjust the engin time or turbocharg boost to suit the gasolin be us on most car howev you should us the cheapest ga that make your car run well check your owner s manual for detail on what your car need q my car wa made for lead gasolin will unlead ga hurt it a it is possibl that unlead ga mai slightli increas valv wear although the amoco oil compani argu otherwis the actual increas in valv wear will be almost unnotic howev as modern lead gasolin actual contain veri littl lead you should howev check your owner s manual mani car from the earli 1970s do not actual requir lead gasolin q do fuel treatment help what kind should i us a some do and some don t dure the winter it is a good idea to us dry ga howev some mai be harm to fuel inject system never us an addit contain methanol sometim call methyl alcohol such addit mai damag fuel system in car with carb and almost certainli will damag car with fuel inject manufactur s opinion vari on addit contain ethanol sometim call ethyl alcohol if your car ha fuel inject check the owner s manual on your car befor us these most manufactur consid 10% ethanol accept in gasolin addit with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distil ar fine in fuel inject car an occasion bottl of fuel injector cleaner is help in car with fuel injector although mani premium gasolin contain deterg that do the same job some off brand of fuel injector cleaner contain ethanol or methanol alwai check the ingredi befor put anyth in your ga tank there ar a small number of particularli good addit these ar notic more expens that the run of the mill on but work much much better among these ar chevron techron redlin sl 1 wurth lubrimoli ventil sauber and bg 44k a bottl of on of these onc everi six month is highli recommend q what about deterg gasolin a the qualiti of deterg packag in gasolin vari somewhat bmw ha institut a test program and gasolin brand which pass thi test mai advertis that fact sticker indic passag of the test ar now begin to appear on fuel pump at ga station if such gasolin ar us then fuel injector cleaner ar probabl option beforewarn that while us of bmw approv gasolin will keep a clean engin clean thei mai not clean a motor with bad valv deposit lubric question q what do the number and letter in a motor oil design mean a there ar sever differ item encod there is a two letter code indic the type of deterg packag that the manufactur us in the oil thi look like se sf cd or such the s code ar for gasolin engin applic the c code ar for diesel engin applic the second letter is assign in sequenc as new level of protect ar develop thu sf is consid better than se se is consid better than sd and so forth the more notic design is the oil weight thi is either a singl number e g 30 weight or a pair of number separ by the letter w e g 10w30 the latter type is much more commonli us these dai and ar the onli type that most automobil manufactur specifi in oper manual the first number in the design 10w is the appar viscos of the oil when it is cold the w stand for winter the second number 30 is the viscos of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesn t actual get thicker turn from 10 weight to 30 weight as it get hotter what is actual happen is that when the oil is cold it ha the viscos of a cold 10 weight oil as it get hotter it doesn t get thin as fast as a 10w oil would by the time it is up to temperatur it ha the viscos of a hot 30 weight oil note that these number actual specifi rang of viscos not all 10w oil have exactli the same viscos when cold and not all 30 weight oil have the same viscos when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multi grade oil is caus by addit and it ha been report that with the sole except of castrol gtx 10w40 oil do not retain their multi grade characterist well over time 10w30 15w40 and 20w50 oil work veri well though q ar quick lube place ani good a some do adequ work but there ar quit a few incompet on out there let the buyer bewar watch them while thei work make sure that thei don t overtorqu the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all time q ar oil addit like slick 50 or tufoil ani good a slick 50 and tufoil ar ptfe base addit mani of these have come onto the market recent thei ar differ from the moli base addit that have been around sinc the earli 50 s ptfe is the chemic name for teflon tm a trademark own by dupont in gener auto manufactur do not recommend us of these product most usenet respons to question on these addit ar favor slight increas of mpg after applic smoother rev but long term result whether ptfe addit ar effect after 5k mile ar debat some manufactur such as saab claim that either the product or the engin flush that prece applic caus deterior of the oil seal and eventu leakag some bmw owner have report death of valv seal shortli after the addit of slick 50 to their car thi writer ha been caution by a slick 50 dealer that slick 50 should _not_ be us in japanes motor as it mai clog the oil return passag in the engin otherwis there ar no known report of damag caus by ptfe addit on the other hand there ar satifi slick 50 custom in the world q do synthet oil realli work a ye but more specif most auto manufactu accept synthet but disagre with the extrem long oil chang interv claim by oil manufactur auto manufactur recommend that you continu to chang oil at the interv recommend in the owner manual for your car even if you decid to try the longer interv at least chang the oil filter at regular interv as synthet get just as dirti as convent oil synthet gear lubric for manual transmiss ar anoth matter entir amsoil redlin and agip ar veri highli regard and veri effect mobil 1 synthet gear lube get mix review howev q manufactur ar specifi longer and longer oil chang interv how often should i chang my oil a it depend on how you drive if your car alwai or nearli alwai get warm up and you don t drive it veri hard and keep the rev down the manufactur s recommend is probabl fine if howev you drive it hard drive it at high rev or altern if you onli drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn t get up to temperatur then you mai wish to chang oil much more often perhap at 3000 mile interv given that most manufactur ar now specifi 7500 mile interv if you don t drive your car much at all sai 7500 mile a year then you probabl want to chang oil everi six month anywai if you ar store a car dure the winter then chang oil befor store it and chang oil when you bring it out of storag misc question q my car ha a time belt i hear that bad thing happen when thei break what s the stori a it depend on the intern design of the motor earli ford escort for exampl will suffer sever valv damag if the belt break but the newer car will just requir a tow and instal of a new belt some honda motor will not be damag but other will be if no replac interv is specifi for your car then chang the belt at least everi 60 000 mile some car mai requir more frequent replac ask your dealer or independ mechan also ask if there ar ani relat repair that should take place at the same time for exampl the same ford escort that suffer valv damag also have a time belt driven water pump which ha been known to seiz destroi the time belt and which then caus major valv damag as a side effect replac the time belt while ignor the water pump can be a costli mistak q why would anyon be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destruct when the time belt break a for perform reason compromis piston design so that the valv and piston will not collid requir that the compress ratio of the engin be reduc significantli thi is why you ar more like to avoid valv damag in economi car than in perform orient vehicl q what caus unintend acceler a the final report of the nation highwai transport and safeti administr conclud that unintend acceler could not be caus by ani mechan failur of the vehicl in question and at the same time be consist with the physic evid the nhtsa report goe on to conclud that pedal misappl by the vehicl oper is probabl the caus richard welti 518 393 7228 welti cabot balltown cma com noth good ha ever been report about the full rotat of a race car about either it pitch or roll axi carrol smith
