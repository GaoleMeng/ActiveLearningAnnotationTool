on the internet is primarili determin by their email address in the sens that thi is their most unchang face in the electron realm thi is your login name qualifi by the complet address domain inform for exampl ld231782 long lanc colost edu peopl see thi address when receiv mail or read usenet post from you and in other situat where program record usag some obsolet form of address such as bitnet still persist in email messag addit inform on the path that a messag take is prepend to the messag receiv by the recipi thi inform identifi the chain of host involv in the transmiss and is a veri accur trace of it origin thi type of identifi and forward protocol is also us in the usenet protocol to a lesser extent forg these field requir corrupt mail softwar at site involv in the forward and is veri uncommon not so uncommon is forg the chain at the origin point so that all initi site in the list ar fake at the time the messag is creat trace these messag can be difficult or imposs when the initi fake field ar name of real machin and repres real transfer rout _____ 1 2 why is ident un import on the internet the concept of ident is close intertwin with commun privaci and secur which in turn ar all critic aspect of comput network for exampl the conveni of commun afford by email would be imposs without convent for identif but there ar mani potenti abus of ident possibl that can have veri sever consequ with massiv comput network at the forefront of the issu which can potenti either exacerb or solv these problem verifi that an ident is correct is call authent and on classic exampl of the problem associ with it is h g well s war of the world radio broadcast that fool segment of the popul into think that an alien invas wa in progress hoax of thi order ar not uncommon on usenet and forg ident make them more insidi peopl and their reput can be assault by forgeri howev the fluiditi of ident on the internet is for some on of it most attract featur ident is just as us as it is harm a professor might carefulli explain a topic until he find he is talk to an undergradu a person of a particular occup mai be abl to convers with other who might normal shun him some prejudic ar

of the usernam ar base on rather arbitrari organ such as mostli invis network cabl distribut the onli point to make is that earli field in the address ar more specif such as specif comput name or

to help find user id s of particular peopl given their real name and solv mail rout problem the sysadmin i e root address mai also be abl to suppli inform user with relat email address mai have inform howev all of these method reli on the time and patienc of other so us them minim on of the most basic tool for determin ident over the internet is the unix util finger the basic syntax is finger user here there everywher thi util us commun protocol to queri the comput name in the address for inform on the user name the respons is gener complet by the receiv comput and mai be in ani format possibl

usernam you specifi as a substr of all actual full name of user kept in a local databas at some site finger can be us to get a list of all user on the system with a finger address in gener thi is often consid weak secur howev becaus attack know valid user id s to crack password more inform on the field return by finger is given below more inform on finger and locat peopl s email address is given in the email faq such as the whoi lookup util just as you can us these mean to find out about other thei can us them to find out about you you can finger yourself to find out what is publicli

amorph and almost nonexist concept on the internet for a varieti of reason on is the inher fluiditi of cyberspac where peopl emerg and submerg frequent and absenc ar not readili note in the commun most peopl rememb face and voic the primari mean of casual identif in the real world the arbitari and cryptic sequenc of letter and digit compris most email address ar not particularli notic or memor and far from a uniqu identif of an individu who mai us multipl account on multipl machin anywher in the world current internet user do not realli have ani great assur that the messag in email and usenet ar from who thei appear to be a person s mail address is far from an identif of an individu anyon with access to the account e g thei know the password either legitim or otherwis can send mail with that address in the from line email address for an individu tend to chang frequent as thei switch job or make move insid their organ as part of current mail protocol standard forg the from line in mail messag is a fairli trivial oper for mani hacker the statu and path inform prepend to messag by intermedi host is gener unforg in gener while possibl forgeri ar fairli rare on most newsgroup and in email besid these patholog case abv there ar mani basic problem with todai s internet protocol affect identif on the internet internet mail standard describ in rfc 822 ar still evolv rapidli and not entir orderli for exampl standard for mail address mung or pars tend to vari slightli between site and frequent mean the differ between find address and bounc mail domain name and comput name ar frequent chang at site and there ar delai in the propag of thi data address cannot be resolv when certain critic comput crash such as the receiv comput or other comput involv in resolv name into address call nameserv a whole slew of problem is associ with nameserv if thei ar not updat thei will not find name address and even the oper of what constitut updat ha differ interpret at differ site the current internet mail and address protocol ar slightli anachronist in that thei were creat when the network wa somewhat obscur and not widespread with onli a fraction of the traffic it now see todai a larg proport of internet traffic is email compris million of messag _____ 1 6 what is the futur of identif on the internet some new technolog and standard ar introduc facial imag and voic messag into mail and these will improv the sens of commun that come from the familiar of identif howev thei ar not current widespread requir larg amount of data transfer standard softwar and make some compromis in privaci promis new cryptograph techniqu mai make digit signatur and digit authent common see below also the trend in usenet standard is toward greater authent of post inform on the other hand advanc in ensur anonym such as remail ar forthcom see below privaci _____ 2 1 what is privaci on the internet gener while privaci ha multipl connot in societi and perhap even more on the internet in cyberspac most take it to mean that you have exclus us and access to your account and the data store on and and direct to it such as email and you do not encount arbitrari restrict or search in other word other mai obtain data associ with your account but not without your permiss these idea ar probabl both fairli limit and liber in their scope in what most internet user consid their privat domain some user don t expect or want ani privaci some expect and demand it _____ 2 2 why is privaci un import on the internet thi is a somewhat debat and inflammatori topic arous passion opinion on the internet some take privaci for grant and ar rude surpris to find it tenuou or nonexist most govern have rule that protect privaci such as the illeg search and seizur claus of the u s constitut

it is weak i e easi to guess thi secur is significantli diminish somewhat surprisingli and frighteningli to some certain user of the system particularli the administr gener have unlimit access regardless of password and mai grant that access to other thi mean that thei mai read ani file in your account without detect furthermor not univers known most unix system keep fairli extens account

the bag and the geni can t be put back in the bottl in less idiomat term thei believ that the spread of strong cryptographi is alreadi underwai will be social and technic unstopp to date no feasibl system that guarante both secur commun and govern oversight ha been propos the two goal ar larg incompat propos for registr of secret kei by d den on sci crypt for exampl have been met with hot controversi at best and ridicul and deris at worst mainli becaus of concern for the right to privaci and object of inher feasibl electron privaci issu and particularli the proper role of network and the internet will forese becom highli visibl and explos over the next few year anonym _____ 3 1 what is anonym on the internet simpli state anonym is the absenc of ident the ultim in privaci howev there ar sever variat on thi simpl theme a person mai wish to be consist identifi by a certain pseudonym or handl and establish a reput under it in some area provid pseudo anonym a person mai wish to be complet untrac for a singl on wai messag a sort of hit and run or a person mai wish to be openli anonym but carri on a convers with other with either known or anonym ident via an anonym return address a user mai wish to appear as a regular user but actual be untrac sometim a user wish to hide who he is send mail to in addit to the messag itself the anonym item itself mai be direct at individu or group a user mai wish to access some servic and hide all sign of the associ all of these us ar feasibl on the internet but ar current tricki to carri out in practic becaus of all the track mechan inher to oper system and network protocol offici of the nsf and other govern agenc mai be oppos to ani of these us becaus of the potenti for abus nevertheless the inher faceless of larg network will alwai guarante a certain element of anonym _____ 3 2 why is anonym un import on the internet anonym is anoth power tool that can be benefici or problemat depend on it us arguabl absenc of identif is import as the presenc of it it mai be the case that mani strong benefit from electron anonym will be discov that were unforeseen and unpredict becaus true anonym ha been histor veri difficult to establish on can us anonym to make person statement to a colleagu that would sabotag a relationship if state openli such as employ employe scenario on can us it to pass inform and evad ani threat of direct retribut for exampl whistleblow report on govern abus econom social or polit can bring issu to light without fear of stigma or retali sensit person potenti damag inform is often post to some usenet group a riski situat where anonym allow convers to be carri on complet independ of the ident of the particip some polic depart run phone servic that allow anonym report of crime such us would be straightforward on the network unfortun extort and harass becom more insidi with assur of anonym _____ 3 3 how can anonym be protect on the internet the chief mean as allud to abov ar mask ident in email and post howev anonym account public account as access and anonym as e g public telephon mai be effect as well but thi us is gener not offici support and even discourag by some system adminstr and nsf guidelin the nonuniform in the requir of obtain account at differ site and institut make anonym account gener difficult to obtain to the public at larg mani commun protocol ar inher detriment to anonym virtual everi protocol in exist current contain inform on both sender and receiv in everi packet new commun protocol will like develop that guarante much higher degre of secur anonym commun _____ 3 4 what is anonym mail on approach to anonym mail ha been to set up an anonym server that when activ by email to it address respond by alloc and suppli an anonym id that is uniqu to the person request it base on hi email address thi will vari for the same person for differ machin address email origin to send anonym mail the user send email direct to the server contain the final destin the server anonym the messag by strip of identif inform and forward the messag which appear to origin from the anonym server onli from the correspond anonym user id thi is the interact us of anonym or pseudonym mention abov anoth more fring approach is to run a cypherpunk remail from a regular user account no root system privileg ar requir these ar current be pioneer by eric hugh and hal finnei hal alumni caltech edu the oper run a process on a machin that anonym mail sent to him with certain characterist that distinguish it from hi regular incom mail typic field in the header on ha been implement as a perl script run on unix sever of these ar in exist current but site and softwar current ar highli unstabl thei mai be in oper outsid of system administr knowledg the remail don t gener support anonym return address mail that is incorrectli address is receiv by the oper gener the user of the remail ha to disavow ani respons for the messag forward through hi system although actual mai be held liabl regardless these approach have sever seriou disadvantag and weak the anonym server approach requir maintain a map of anonym id s to real address that must be maintain indefinit on altern is to allow dealloc of alias at the request of the user but thi ha not been implement yet although an unlik scenario traffic to ani of these site could conceiv be monitor from the outsid necessit the us of cryptographi for basic protect local administr can shut them down either out of capric or under pressur from local network or govern agenc unscrupul provid of the servic can monitor the traffic that goe through them most remail current keep log that mai be inspect the cypherpunk approach tend to be highli unstabl becaus these oper ar basic network user who do not own the equip and ar account to their own system administr who mai be unawar of the us and unsympathet to the philosophi of anonym when the oper is discov regard it as illicit us in all case a high degre of trust is place in the anonym server oper by the user current the most direct rout to anonym involv us smtp protocol to submit a messag directli to a server with arbitrari field inform thi practic not uncommon to hacker and the approach us by remail is gener view with hostil by most system administr inform in the header rout data and log of network port connect inform mai be retain that can be us to track the origin site in practic thi is gener infeas and rare carri out some administr on the network will contact local administr to request a messag be track and it writer admonish or punish more sever such as revok the account all of thi actual happen occasion but infrequ see the section known anonym mail and post site and respons associ with anonym _____ 3 5 what is anonym post anonym server have been establish as well for anonym usenet post with all the associ caveat abov monitor traffic caprici or riski local circumst log make sure to test the system at least onc by e g anonym post to misc test howev some oper don t recommend thi becaus mani site autorespond to test messag possibl caus the anonym server to alloc anonym id for those machin see the responsibilti associ with anonym post befor proceed anoth direct rout involv us nntp protocol to submit a messag directli to a newserv with arbitrari field inform thi practic not uncommon to hacker is also gener view with hostil by most system administr and similar consequ can ensu see the section known anonym mail and post site and respons associ with anonym _____ 3 6 why is anonym un stabl on the internet as note mani factor compromis the anonym current avail to the gener internet commun and these servic should be us with great caution to summar the technolog is in it infanc and current approach ar unrefin unreli and not complet trustworthi no standard have been establish and troubl situat of loss of anonym and bug in the softwar ar preval here ar some encount and potenti bug on anonym remail realloc alreadi alloc anonym return address other pass signatur inform embed in messag unalt address resolut problem result in anonym mail bounc to a remail ar common forgeri to the anonym server itself ar a problem possibl allow unauthor user to potenti glean anon id email address map in the alia file thi can be remedi with the us of password infinit mail loop ar possibl with chain remail sourc code is be distribut test and refin for these system but standard ar progress slowli and weakli the field is not like to improv consider without offici endors and action by network agenc the whole idea is essenti still in it infanc and view with suspicion and distrust by mani on the internet seen as illegitim or favor to crimin the major object to anonym over regular internet us is the perceiv lack of account to system oper i e invulner to account restrict result from outsid complaint system adminstr at some site have threaten to filter anonym new post gener by the promin server from their redistribut flow thi mai onli have the effect of encourag server oper to creat less characterist detect header probabl the least problemat approach and the most tradit to usenet is for individu user to deal with anonym mail howev thei prefer e g ignor it or filter it with kill file _____ 3 7 what is the futur of anonym on the internet new anonym protocol effect serv to significantli increas safeguard of anonym for exampl the same mechan that rout email over multipl host therebi threaten it privaci can also be us to guarante it in a scheme call chain an anonym messag is pass through multipl anonym server befor reach a destin in thi wai gener multipl link of the chain have to be broken for secur to be compromis re encrypt at each link make thi scenario even more unlik even more significantli the anonym remail could be spread over the internet global so that local weak such as corrupt govern or legal wiretap within a nation would be more unlik to sacrific overal secur by messag trace howev remail run by corrupt oper ar possibl the futur of anonym servic on the internet is at thi time highli uncertain and fraught with peril while specif group seem to benefit significantli from anonym post capabl mani feel that unlimit newsgroup scope for anonym post is a disrupt and danger idea and detract from discuss in seriou group the introduct of unlimit group anonym mai have fundament repercuss on usenet convent and distribut mechan such as moder and alt group have had in the past for exampl as part of new group creation the charter mai specifi whether anonym post is un welcom nevertheless the widespread introduct and us of anonym mai be inevit base on traffic statist anonym servic ar in huge demand pervas and readili avail anonym could carri signific and unforeseen social consequ howev if it us is continu to be gener regard as subvers it mai be confin to the underground the ramif of widespread introduct of anonym to usenet ar still larg unknown it is unclear whether it will provok signfic amount of new traffic or instead of expans caus a shift where a greater portion of exist traffic is anonym conceiv the servic could plai a role in influenc futur mainstream social accept of usenet thi
