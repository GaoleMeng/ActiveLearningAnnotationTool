in 1993apr4 200253 21409 ennew ea asu edu guncer enuxha ea asu edu selim guncer write you might not like what bernard lewi write about label him as a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepres me selim the hard evid for my statement about hi lack of object ar present quit clearli in the book orient by edward said edward said by the wai is a christian not a muslim i think he is pretti much object in hi treatment in race and slaveri in the middl east sinc he clearli distinguish between slaveri under islam and the practic of slaveri in other countri like the us prior to the civil war he also doe not conceal that there ar vers in the quran which promot the liber of slave what he doesn t and i don t think nobodi can deduc from these vers is that slaveri will eventu be abolish in islam countri now you might rather conveni blame the practic of slaveri on muslim but the fact ar out there i also fail to see the relev of the claim of lewi be a zionist to what i wrote regard bernard lewi him be a zionist give him a polit motiv for hi give misrepresent and half truth about islam read orient by edward said see the evid for yourself in fact i mai post some of it here if it isn t too long thei were encyclopaed inform which anybodi can access that slaveri wa abolish at certain date some 1200 year after muham that thi wa the caus of tension in the ottoman empir between the arab slave trader and the govern etc we also have in the asu librari volum of british document on slaveri where report and document concern slaveri all around the world can be found which i check some of the incid lewi mention so i don t think on polit stanc ha anyth to do with documentari evid i haven t read lewi s articl so i can t comment directli upon it and have onli spoken about hi write _in gener_ so far that hi polit motiv make him a bias writer on islam hi anti islam polem as i understand it ar often quit subtl and ar often base on tell half truth again read orient by edward said i am _not_ ask you to take what i sai on trust in fact i am urg you not to do so but to get thi book it is a well known book and check the evid out for _yourself_ the issu i rais wa that slave were us for sexual purpos when it wa claim that islam prohibit extra marit sex i wrote that the prophet himself had concubin i wrote an incid in which the prophet advis on someon who did not want hi concubin to get pregnant etc which is contrari to the notion that sex is for procreat onli in other word such claim ar baseless in the quran and the hadith if slaveri is _in realiti_ as oppos to in the practic of some muslim oppos by islam then us slave for sexual purpos is necessarili oppos too i seem to be unsucces in get through to you islam is not advoc slaveri slaveri wa an exist institut in the 7th centuri it advis on slave be freed for good deed etc which is noth new mani cultur saw thi as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argu rightfulli that slave were discourag about think about their status polit the quran reward the good slave so obei your master and perhap on dai you ll be free but it is veri understand that i do not commun with muslim sinc thei assum the quran is from a god and i think it is a rule base system impos on the societi for preserv of the statu quo slave ar a part of thi system the subordin of women so that their function in societi boil down to child make is a part of thi system etc i understand your point of view selim i think rather it is _us_ who ar not get through to _you_ some of the point you repeat abov i have alreadi answer befor regard women i have made post after post on thi subject show that islam is not anti woman etc howev have you been complet ignor my post or just miss them i just repost a veri good on under the titl islam and women repost from soc religion islam if thi ha alreadi disappear from your site then pleas email me tell me so and i will email you a copi of thi excel articl imho your understand of the issu of women in islam is sadli defici regard slave _my_ post on slaveri the second on i made which is a repost of an articl i wrote earli last year is base complet on the qur an and contain numer qur anic vers and hadith to support it point of view our approach ar differ you ar argu from a histor standpoint and i am argu directli from the teach of the qur an and hadith now just becaus peopl sai thei ar muslim and perform a particular action doe that automat mean that their action is part of islam even if it is oppos by the qur an and sunnah no of cours not let me give you a concret exampl which might help clarifi thi for you the qur an prohibit drink now if a person sai i am a muslim and then proce to drink a bottl of beer doe thi now mean that islam teach that peopl should drink beer of cours not and onli an idiot would think so do you see my point it is veri natur to think that the author author of the quran had no idea that the socio econom structur thei were advoc would experi at least two paradigm shift in 1400 year in the western cultur first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerc second with the industri revolut well rule have chang and the statu quo ha driven muslim countri into miseri try to surviv in a heathen world muslim countri have fail econom thei were unabl to accumul ani wealth directli due to the uncomprimis econom rule in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easili be model after the pyramid effect you do not produc ani wealth at home but increas your wealth by conquer place you ar judg islam here on capitalist term capit is an ideolog base larg on the assumpt that peopl want to maximis their wealth thi assumpt is in opposit to islam teach to sai islam is bad becaus it is not capitalist is pretti unthink islam doe not pretend to be capitalist and doe not try to be capitalist thi doe not mean that islam doe not support a free market for it doe in gener but there ar other part of capit which ar oppos to islam as i understand it when thi stop you and i were left bare in the open for emperialist to devour no capit no industri veri poor social servic the educ level in muslim countri ar the lowest in the world the health statist ar miser etc on can postul numer reason for thi your theori is that it is becaus islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear histor exampl to show you the fallaci of your view if you think as you obvious do that islam lack of educ and power for a larg part of histori the islam world wa veri power for a signific section of histori the islam world wa the foremost in the scienc so to sai that islam is for exampl anti educ is complet absurd you try to blame thi situat on islam histori show that your conclus is fals and that instead there must be other reason for thi situat you blame muslim for not follow the quran but i blame muslim for follow the quran well selim your viewpoint on women in islam make me question the extent of your knowledg of islam i realli think you ar not knowledg enough to be abl to judg whether the muslim ar follow the qur an or not your idea is baseless from histor fact it is a poor utopia the islam world wa at the forefront of the world in scienc at on stage yet somehow in your theori it is by follow the qur an that muslim ar backward in educ selim it is _your_ thesi that is anti histor for you conveni overlook thi histor fact which contradict your theori while my idea ar deriv from social and econom histori you have certainli not shown thi you have mere state it so far it seem to me that your view on islam be anti educ is quit contrari to histori that you ar so convinc of your view make me wonder just how object you ar try to look at all of thi my solut to all muslim is simpl cut the crap i think selim you should consid take your own advic get the fact straight here too and work hard to revers the effect of 1300 year of ignor selim you have such convict of your viewpoint yet you demonstr ignor not onli of islam but also of islam histori particularli with respect to muslim be leader of scienc till about 1400 or so i think yet you sai that your viewpoint is base on histori selim if i rememb right you sai in on of your earlier post that you ar an apost from islam i think you should slow down and start think clearli about the issu and start _read_ some of our post about islam rather than ignor them as you so obvious have fred rice daric yoyo cc monash edu au
