thi might be better direct to s r c bibl studi which i have begun read but sinc my earlier note were post to thi forum i will conclud here as well a week ago i manag to find time to consult a septuagint concord and a lxx text with apparatu at the librari and i can now usefulli conclud my look at the greek word for love as us in the christian background of the septuagint translat of the jewish scriptur the princip result is that there is a cluster of us of the verbal noun from _erao _ _erast s_ mean lover thi cluster occur just where on might most expect it in the propeth imag and accus of israel as faithless spous to yhwh the vers in question ar hosea 2 5 7 10 jeremiah 4 30 22 20 22 lament 1 19 and ezekiel 16 33 36 37 and 23 5 9 22 hosea seem to have origin thi usag which jeremiah and ezekiel pick up lament is depend on though not like written by jeremiah the erot mean in it allegor us not at all liter is evid so too in english unless you complement it with a phrase like of the art the word lover is go to have an overton of sexual relationship there is no surpris here but it is worthwhil to see that standard greek usag doe show up in the translat from the hebrew more interestingli and some confirm of my guess that later koin usag avoid the verb _erao _ becaus of it homonymi to _ero _ sai _eromai_ ask there is an error in codex vaticanu normal a veri valuabl wit where a form of _erao _ is us in a complet absurd context 2 samuel 20 18 where the mean must be sai in addit to the abov and the us i have alreadi mention in proverb esther 2 17 us the verb in it most natur applic kai e rasth ho basileu esth r and the king love esther and rather more interestingli 1 samuel 19 2 suppli a modest degre of support to the gai apprais of the relationship of david and jonathan kai io nathan huio saoul e i reito ton dauid sphodra and jonathan saul s son love david intens i m us the bracket i for io ta subscript which i don t yet have a reason ascii convent for the relev of thi to the gai issu is not anyth implicit about the histor fact but just that a quasi offici translat of the hebrew text in the hellenist period make no bone about us the erot verb in thi context given the quit gener usag of _agapao _ for erot sens thi need not mean anyth more than _agapao _ alon would mean but it doe disambigu the relationship as far as thi translat goe michael l siemon
