than a year he explain that there is no militari purpos that is serv by the destruct of it fabric and it peopl abov all few of those align with the forc attack sarajevo would want to live there even if the citi could be rebuilt thei ar not citi peopl it is thi i believ asid from a desir to break the moral of bosnian and make them press their govern to accept peac at ani price that explain the conduct of the sieg of sarajevo i t is a loath for all that is urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that ha made sarajevo the object for devast histor most of the serbian popul in bosnia and herzegovina ha been rural while muslim who were the civil servant and intelligentsia dure the centuri of ottoman rule made up a disproportion share of the urban popul the destruct of sarajevo is not onli an express of hostil against thi citi it is also an attack on the urban idea the demagogu who whip up the passion let loos by thi war exploit not onli ethnic and religi bigotri but also hatr for all that is cosmopolitan the light that neier shed on the issu help to clarifi what is at stake the serb repres the know noth anti secularist fundamentalist fascist forc who ar attack the urban cosmopolitan secular multi cultur idea thei ar attack the rest of us just as hitler did on ironi is that at the begin of the crisi over bosnia it wa for awhil maintain by the serb and their support that thei were respond to a threat by the bosnian muslim to creat a fundamentalist state neier ha shown that it is the serb who ar the great threat to secular multi cultur divers and democraci it s the serb who ar attack the democrat notion the democrat idea anthoni lewi come close to the point when he ask why doe respect for clinton s presid depend on hi act effect against serbian aggress first of all becaus to do noth about genocid would be such a betray of the valu we and our alli profess time 4 26 93 but it s not mere a betray of our valu it s becaus the serb ar attack us by proxi just as hitler wa on argument for decis action by the west that is heard in a differ form is that war in the balkan is destabl for europ we hear it as the bosnian ar europ s palestinian that is to sai just as the palestinian refuge problem ha been the kei to instabl in the middl east just so will the hundr of thousand of yugoslav refuge of all ethnic result in turmoil in europ for decad to come on of the lesson of the twentieth centuri is that even though the atlant ocean divid us the america ar ultim ti to the destini of europ if europ is destabil the u s will inevit be affect and drawn into it problem as in a whirlpool sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom and as past histori and pfaff have shown it s much better if we do so decis quickli and on our term sincer ronald bleier
