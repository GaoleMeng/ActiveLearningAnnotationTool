read from a amoco perform product data sheet their erl 1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforc ha a compress strength of 280 000 psi it ha a densiti of 0 058 lb cu in therefor the theoret height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4 8 million inch or 400 000 ft or 75 statut mile now a real structur will have horizont brace either a truss type or gui wire or both and will be us below the crush strength let us assum that we will oper at 40% of the theoret strength thi give a work height of 30 mile for a constant section column a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build someth if you allow a taper of the cross section as you go up for exampl let us sai you have a 280 000 pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplic in calcul thi requir 2 5 squar inch of column cross section area to support the weight the mile of structur below the payload will itself weigh 9 200 lb so at 1 mile below the payload the total load is now 289 200 lb a 3 3% increas the next mile of structur must be 3 3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plu the payload each mile of structur must increas in area by the same ratio all the wai to the bottom we can see from thi that there is no theoret limit on area although there will be practic limit base on how much composit we can afford to by at $40 lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundat that the bedrock can support let us arbitrarili choos $1 billion as the limit in costruct cost with thi we can afford perhap 10 000 000 lb of composit assum our finish structur cost $100 lb the $40 lb figur is just for materi cost then we have a tower payload mass ratio of 35 7 1 at a 3 3% mass ratio per mile the tower height becom 111 mile thi is clearli abov the signific atmospher a rocket launch from the top of the tower will still have to provid orbit veloc but atmospher drag and g loss will be almost elimin g loss ar the compon of rocket thrust in the vertic direct to counter graviti but which do not contribut to horizont orbit veloc thu thei repres wast thrust togeth with drag rocket start from the ground have a 15% veloc penalti to contend with thi analysi is simplifi in that it doe not consid wind load these will requir more structur support over the first 15 mile of height abov that the air pressur drop to a low enough valu for it not to be a big factor dani eder dani eder meridian invest compani 205 464 2697 w 232 7467 h rt 1 box 188 2 athen al 35611 locat 34deg 37 n 86deg 43 w 100m alt
