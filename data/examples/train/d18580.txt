toni i read your post it wa noth new i had seen much the same in other typic christian anti gai sentiment literatur gai peopl ar and will con tinu to be persecut as long as such propaganda petpetu you mai be unawar of all the statistica find concern african american that have been publish and us by variou group to re enforc their own bia against african american we usual think of the kkk in these instanc but there ar mani other group of cours the vast major of the public scoff at such find and document todai but that wa not alwai the case fortun african american had white who support their caus and public sentiment wa eventu if not entir turn around there wa even a civil war and anti negro sentiment increas in fact until law were put in place to protect the inalien right of black it wa pretti much legal to discrimin against them i know mani gai and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimin you mai think that i have been deceiv or someth that is your perog my church christian church discipl of christ openli affirm the right of oppress peopl of all segment of societi includ gai we believ the gospel messag of preach to all creation and make discipl we believ in the lord s great command to love and we beleiv in stand up for the oppress even if it is not popular to do so i realli like my church for last reason the most i can find a church almost anywher in the vallei that stand for the gospel and believ in the command of love though i m hard press to find mani who actual sho love but not mani ar will to champion the oppress especi within their own commun i mai have lost face with the greater christian commun for the unpopular of my belief but so did the abolitionist against the oppress of african american mani were even kill and treat as runawai slave for be nigger lover and such i guess i ve decid the challeng is worth it in my talk with gai men and women i have heard tragic stori after tragic stori center around fail marriag wive and husband who ar straight who have been hurt in the process etc funni thing is i don t know of on case where the parent ex wive or even children have continu to reject their gai famili member son daughter ex husband father etc after thei began to take part in some form of support group like pflag i m apal by the legisl which pass in colorado and am equal out0 rage that such slimei peopl as loui sheldon from the tradit valu coalit have been activ work in the christian underground to garner support within sever 8 i believ state thi come novemb for more oppress legis against gai perhap you don t get it and mayb you never will mani didn t get it in the middl ag and the proclaim god s will be done as thei massacr thousand in witch hunt and inquisit the messag that come through loud and clear by propon against gai right and against gai in gener is that there is a strong dislik even hatr for gai whether you want to call it such or not it doesn t chang the result the major flaw in all thi postur is that in the end the final effect of post like that of your and mr hudson is that you have a condit love for gai condit chang and we ll love you thi is sure strang come from a group who claim that god ha an uncondit love on that call peopl just as thei ar sure there ar thing that will natur chang and habit like alcohol wife beat etc that need to be chang through some sort of therapi but then there ar thing like left handed etc that no amount of beat it out of peopl is go to result in anyth more than an outward conforminti to other peopl s expect in the process thi coerc conform caus mani peopl a great deal of harm especi when it is caus by peopl who have noth more to gain from it that to becom even more puf up about their own sens of pseuper spiritu thi is sad but i thoroughli believ that on dai it will chang it mai be unpopular to cry for justic and equal when the basi ha to do with someth veri person like sexual a taboo subject even todai but i firmli believ in the right of individu to be free from impos regul on thier bedroom it s funni that most straight peopl have successfulli remov restrict and oppress legisl against invas legisl but we like to maintain thi littl chestnut of repress as though it help us maintain a sens of superior over at least on segment of societi gai peopl ar not crimin anoth interest thing happen recent a veri promin charismat church in the silicon vallei here had two of it s pastor arrest for self admit charg of pederasti men have sex with boi thi had appar been go on for some time a coupl year but sinc the charg were voluntari and the church work close with the polic so i imagin that wa how thei manag to downplai it in the media how could such a thing happen when the church itself ha an ex gai ministri on of my friend recent told me he wa approach by someon who is go through the reparit therapi there and he wa thoroughli convinc that the request for dinner wa not an invit to attend the ministri these ar difficult time we live in but provid hostil environ and creat and perpetu an atmospher that breed hate and violenc is not the call of the christian commun the result of the pass amend in colorado ha creat an organ who s poster ar appear all over colorado call s t r a i g h t i forget the whole definit off hand but the last part wa against immor gross homosexu trash and their motto is work for a fag free america with an implicit advoc for violenc thi is sick and it seem to be what you and mr hudson and other ar embrac we christian have a loooooooooong tradit of coersion and oppress toward those we feel don t measur up and constant berat from organ like the christian research institut while thei do have a good purpos also their major work seem to be find new and better wai of exclud peopl the gospel i believ is not so neg rather it seek wai to includ peopl i have sever of dr martin s book and find them quit help especi concern cult but it seem that cri ha becom a cult unto itself why don t we just stick to the posit and find wai to bring peopl to jesu istead of take bullwhip and drive them awai whatev rich
