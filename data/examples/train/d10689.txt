the first part befor the rest we don t have the time to send out miss part by mail so don t ask note such as kah67 refer to the refer list in the last part the section of thi faq ar avail via anonym ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet new answer cryptographi faq part xx the cryptographi faq is post to the newsgroup sci crypt sci answer and new answer everi 21 dai content how do i recov from lost password in wordperfect how do i break a vigener repeat kei cipher how do i send encrypt mail under unix pgp ripem pem is the unix crypt command secur how do i us compress with encrypt is there an unbreak cipher what doe random mean in cryptographi what is the unic point a k a unic distanc what is kei manag and why is it import can i us pseudo random or chaotic number as a kei stream what is the correct frequenc list for english letter what is the enigma how do i shuffl card can i foil s w pirat by encrypt my cd rom can you do automat cryptanalysi of simpl cipher what is the code system us by vcr how do i recov from lost password in wordperfect wordperfect encrypt ha been shown to be veri easi to break the method us xor with two repeat kei stream a type password and a byte wide counter initi to 1 the password length full descript ar given in bennett ben87 and bergen and caelli ber91 chri gala write someon awhil back wa look for a wai to decrypt wordperfect document file and i think i have a solut there is a softwar compani name accessdata 87 east 600 south orem ut 84058 1 800 658 5199 that ha a softwar packag that will decrypt ani wordperfect lotu 1 2 3 quatro pro ms excel and paradox file the cost of the packag is $185 steep price but if you think your pw kei is less than 10 charact or 10 char give them a call and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt file that have a 10 char or less pw kei how do i break a vigener repeat kei cipher a repeat kei cipher where the ciphertext is someth like the plaintext xor keykeykeykei and so on is call a vigener cipher if the kei is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the follow 1 discov the length of the kei by count coincid see gain gai44 sinkov sin66 try each displac of the ciphertext against itself count those byte which ar equal if the two ciphertext portion have us the same kei someth over 6% of the byte will be equal if thei have us differ kei then less than 0 4% will be equal assum random 8 bit byte of kei cover normal ascii text the smallest displac which indic an equal kei is the length of the repeat kei 2 shift the text by that length and xor it with itself thi remov the kei and leav you with text xore with itself sinc english ha about 1 bit of real inform per byte 2 stream of text xore togeth ha 2 bit of info per 8 bit byte provid plenti of redund for choos a uniqu decrypt and in fact on stream of text xore with itself ha just 1 bit per byte if the kei is short it might be even easier to treat thi as a standard polyalphabet substitut all the old cryptanalysi text show how to break those it s possibl with those method in the hand of an expert if there s onli ten time as much text as kei see for exampl gain gai44 sinkov sin66 how do i send encrypt mail under unix pgp ripem pem here s on popular method us the de command cat file compress de privat_kei uuencod mail meanwhil there is a de jure internet standard in the work call pem privaci enhanc mail it is describ in rfc 1421 through 1424 to join the pem mail list contact pem dev request ti com there is a beta version of pem be test at the time of thi write there ar also two program avail in the public domain for encrypt mail pgp and ripem both ar avail by ftp each ha it own newsgroup alt secur pgp and alt secur ripem each ha it own faq as well pgp is most commonli us outsid the usa sinc it us the rsa algorithm without a licens and rsa s patent is valid onli or at least primarili in the usa ripem is most commonli us insid the usa sinc it us the rsaref which is freeli avail within the usa but not avail for shipment outsid the usa sinc both program us a secret kei algorithm for encrypt the bodi of the messag pgp us idea ripem us de and rsa for encrypt the messag kei thei should be abl to interoper freeli although there have been repeat call for each to understand the other s format and algorithm choic no interoper is avail at thi time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secur no see ree84 there is a program avail call cbw crypt breaker s workbench which can be us to do ciphertext onli attack on file encrypt with crypt on sourc for cbw is ftpcb how do i us compress with encrypt a number of peopl have propos do perfect compress follow by some simpl encrypt method e g xor with a repeat kei unfortun you can onli compress perfectli if you know the exact distribut of possibl input for all practic purpos it s imposs to describ the typic english text beyond coars characterist such as singl letter frequenc you can build up more and more sophist model of your input but if the enemi ha a slightli more accur model he ll be abl to find some redund in your compress output note that nearli all practic compress scheme unless thei have been design with cryptographi in mind produc output that actual start off with high redund for exampl the output of unix compress begin with a well known three byte magic number that can serv as an enter wedg for cryptanalysi thi is not to sai that compress befor encrypt is inher a bad idea it just ha to be done veri veri carefulli and by no mean remov the need for strong encrypt compress after encrypt is silli is there an unbreak cipher ye the on time pad is unbreak see part 4 unfortun the on time pad requir secur distribut of as much kei materi as plaintext of cours a cryptosystem need not be utterli unbreak to be us rather it need to be strong enough to resist attack by like enemi for whatev length of time the data it protect is expect to remain valid what doe random mean in cryptographi cryptograph applic demand much more out of a pseudorandom number gener than most applic for a sourc of bit to be cryptograph random it must be computation imposs to predict what the nth random bit will be given complet knowledg of the algorithm or hardwar gener the stream and the sequenc of 0th through n 1st bit for all n up to the lifetim of the sourc a softwar gener also known as pseudo random ha the function of expand a truli random seed to a longer string of appar random bit thi seed must be larg enough not to be guess by the oppon ideal it should also be truli random perhap gener by a hardwar random number sourc those who have sparcstat 1 workstat could for exampl gener random number us the audio input devic as a sourc of entropi by not connect anyth to it for exampl cat dev audio compress foo give a file of high entropi not random but with much random in it on can then encrypt that file us part of itself as a kei for exampl to convert that seed entropi into a pseudo random string when look for hardwar devic to provid thi entropi it is import realli to measur the entropi rather than just assum that becaus it look complic to a human it must be random for exampl disk oper complet time sound like thei might be unpredict to mani peopl but a spin disk is much like a clock and it output complet time ar rel low in entropi what is the unic point a k a unic distanc see sha49 the unic distanc is an approxim to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real inform entropi in the correspond sourc text and encrypt kei equal the number of ciphertext bit us ciphertext significantli longer than thi can be shown probabl to have a uniqu decipher thi is us to back up a claim of the valid of a ciphertext onli cryptanalysi ciphertext significantli shorter than thi ar like to have multipl equal valid decrypt and therefor to gain secur from the oppon s difficulti choos the correct on unic distanc like all statist or inform theoret measur doe not make determinist predict but rather give probabilist result name the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is like that there is onli a singl intellig plaintext correspond to the ciphertext when all possibl kei ar tri for the decrypt work cryptologist don t normal deal with unic distanc as such instead thei directli determin the likelihood of event of interest let the unic distanc of a cipher be d charact if fewer than d ciphertext charact have been intercept then there is not enough inform to distinguish the real kei from a set of possibl kei de ha a unic distanc of 17 5 charact which is less than 3 ciphertext block each block correspond to 8 ascii charact thi mai seem alarmingli low at first but the unic distanc give no indic of the comput work requir to find the kei after approxim d charact have been intercept in fact actual cryptanalysi seldom proce along the line us in discuss unic distanc like other measur such as kei size unic distanc is someth that guarante insecur if it s too small but doesn t guarante secur if it s high few practic cryptosystem ar absolut impervi to analysi all manner of characterist might serv as enter wedg to crack some cipher messag howev similar inform theoret consider ar occasion us for exampl to determin a recommend kei chang interv for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalyst also emploi a varieti of statist and inform theoret test to help guid the analysi in the most promis direct unfortun most literatur on the applic of inform statist to cryptanalysi remain classifi even the semin 1940 work of alan ture see koz84 for some insight into the possibl see kul68 and goo83 what is kei manag and why is it import on of the fundament axiom of cryptographi is that the enemi is in full possess of the detail of the gener cryptograph system and lack onli the specif kei data emploi in the encrypt of cours on would assum that the cia doe not make a habit of tell mossad about it cryptosystem but mossad probabl find out anywai repeat us of a finit amount of kei provid redund that can eventu facilit cryptanalyt progress thu especi in modern commun system where vast amount of inform ar transfer both parti must have not onli a sound cryptosystem but also enough kei materi to cover the traffic kei manag refer to the distribut authent and handl of kei a publicli access exampl of modern kei manag technolog is the stu iii secur telephon unit which for classifi us emploi individu code crypto ignit kei and a central kei manag center oper by nsa there is a hierarchi in that certain cik ar us by author cryptograph control personnel to valid the issuanc of individu traffic kei and to perform instal mainten function such as the report of lost cik thi should give an inkl of the extent of the kei manag problem for public kei system there ar sever relat issu mani have to do with whom do you trust can i us pseudo random or chaotic number as a kei stream chaotic equat and fractal produc an appar random from rel compact gener perhap the simplest exampl is a linear congruenti sequenc on of the most popular type of random number gener where there is no obviou depend between seed and output unfortun the graph of ani such sequenc will in a high enough dimens show up as a regular lattic mathemat thi lattic correspond to structur which is notori easi for cryptanalyst to exploit more complic gener have more complic structur which is why thei make interest pictur but a cryptograph strong sequenc will have no comput structur at all see knu81 exercis 3 5 7 ree77 and boi89 what is the correct frequenc list for english letter there ar three answer to thi question each slightli deeper than the on befor you can find the first answer in variou book name a frequenc list comput directli from a certain sampl of english text of cours ani such list will be correctli comput but exactli which list you get depend on which sampl wa taken the second answer is that the question doesn t make sens what do you mean by english letter the english languag is not a fix finit close object that can be exactli character it ha chang over time it is differ between differ author ani particular messag will have differ statist from those of the languag as a whole the third answer is that ye no particular messag is go to have exactli the same characterist as english in gener but for all reason statist us these slight discrep won t matter in fact there s an entir field call bayesian statist other buzzword ar maximum entropi method and maximum likelihood estim which studi question like what s the chanc that a text with these letter frequenc is in english and come up with reason robust answer so make your own list from your own sampl of english text it will be good enough for practic work if you us it properli what is the enigma for a project in data secur we ar look for sourc of inform about the german enigma code and how it wa broken by the british dure wwii see wel82 dea85 koz84 hod83 kah91 how do i shuffl card card shuffl is a special case of the permut of an arrai of valu us a random or pseudo random function all possibl output permut of thi process should be equal like to do thi you need a random function modran x which will produc a uniformli distribut random integ in the interv 0 x 1 given that function you can shuffl with the follow c code assum arrlth is the length of arrai arr and swap interchang valu at the two address given for n arrlth 1 n 0 n swap arr modran n 1 arr n modran x can not be achiev exactli with a simpl ranno % x sinc ranno s interv mai not be divis by x although in most case the error will be veri small to cover thi case on can take ranno s modulu mod x call that number y and if ranno return a valu less than y go back and get anoth ranno valu can i foil s w pirat by encrypt my cd rom someon will frequent express the desir to publish a cd rom with possibl multipl piec of softwar perhap with each encrypt separ and will want to us differ kei for each user perhap even good for onli a limit period of time in order to avoid piraci as far as we know thi is imposs sinc there is noth in standard pc or workstat hardwar which uniqu identifi the user at the keyboard if there were such an identif then the cd rom could be encrypt with a kei base in part on the on sold to the user and in part on the uniqu identifi howev in thi case the cd rom is on of a kind and that defeat the intend purpos if the cd rom is to be encrypt onc and then mass produc there must be a kei or set of kei for that encrypt produc at some stage in the process that kei is useabl with ani copi of the cd rom s data the pirat need onli to isol that kei and sell it along with the illeg copi can you do automat cryptanalysi of simpl cipher schneier chinet chi il us bruce schneier
