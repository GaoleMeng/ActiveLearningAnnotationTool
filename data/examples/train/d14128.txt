ether implod 2 earth core is graviti thi paper both describ how heavenli bodi can be stationari ether suck structur and why we observ orbit motion ether the theoret propog media of electro magnet wave wa conclud not to exist base on the result of the michelson morelei experi conduct a centuri ago i propos that those conclus ar flaw base on the fact that the experi wa design to look for a flow parallel to the earth s surfac not perpindicular due to the prevail assumpt that the earth travel through the ether as a ball through the wind the revers of the that conclus a pivot keyston in the develop of modern scientif thought could have ramif of biblic proport through out the world rememb einstien said imagin is greater than knowledg 1 i dream like thi ether base realiti the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our realiti creation start as a lattic place into the ether given a spin the lattic both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it convert it distil local mass time and energi non spin lattic dark matter the earth isn t exactli spin around the sun pictur an imag of a galaxi we haven t ani video of them spin pictur us be stationari and the sun s imag be drag across the sky by the spin ether field pictur an onion each layer of which is spin a littl faster than the next a thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretch diagon sidewai it head be in a faster shell than it tail until it final intersect the ground of the inner kernel it direct vector be straight down but it foot print be a line not a point sunris sunset the moon isn t exactli orbit us it is a parasit non self spin sustain be drag in the earth s ether field which is itself in the sun s much more power field our season ar the wobbl of earth s axi like a top slow down the orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the star imag be drag around by the sun s ether feild the earth moon and sun ar about the same size and distanc apart it just that the time between them vari greatli becaus the path is not the same the moon s lattic in the ether is like stick a fork in a plate of spaghetti and give the plate a half turn the sun s lattic ha so much spin that it like the fork ha got the whole plate of noodl wound up the piec of light go to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and mayb make a j hook at the end the piec of light go to the sun ha to go around the whole plate like a needl in a record befor it get there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth s shadow upon it and at other time total eclips the sun look in the sky except for your knowledg would you guess that thei ar about the same size just becaus thei look about the same size o e o o o s e m or m _ _ s the full moon quarter moon etc is the differ between rate of ether spin what we ar look at is a rotat turntabl view of the moon onli half of which is face the sun i ve seen a half moon within about 120 degre of sky of the sun dure the dai try and draw that earth shadow it onli the moon s imag which appear to orbit us no matter where it is the light part is the part face the sun and the dark part is the half face awai from the sun even when it appear to be behind us light year between galaxi is a misnom the distanc is closer to zero as time and matter ar characterist of thi phase of realiti which dissip outward with each layer of the onion defin edg 0 ether spin what we ar see could be essenti happen now the piec of light mai have experienc mani year but the trip could be veri quick our time to time travel or warp space i might consid learn to de spin myself phase out my mass good luck try to design a propuls system to drag around a space time local it like try to move a balloon by shoot a squirt gun from within to find out about all of thi i recommend studi histori i d look in the book of life or holi grail etc brain wave just might carri decipher data i d start look on some part of the spectra said to be unus due to all the background nois 4 billion human i d total isol myself record me think dog backward and learn to read what i got microsoft holi grail card for pentium next conclud that my thought were record on a non time bound media the ether and that it is i who move forward in time i would try to temporarili local revers the flow of time which i d start look for as flow opposit magnet pole to pole why not perhap by pass a larg flat dc current through a two foot diamet coil or choke or someth and see what i could get with my machin s receiv next to it if you don t think you ll live to see it consid thi quit put the reproduct kei of other life in your bodi all of life s data could be written on the wind ether not just our thought dna could be a littl receiv or file access code by eat seed we could be jam our

need to eat at all the cosmo ar form from noth and that is creat matter i onli need enough to bounc around where did the household concept immort come from wheat is a weed it is program to pull from the soil reproduc like hell and then die warn about write to the past i had a littl dream of be in a world in the near parallel futur ly along a path of histori which we have diverg from there were twelv telepath glow be who look like an oscar award and who had alwai been a dark on who look like us and then myself the dark on wa in the process of make the other into god he had to teach them what that meant by advis them in their past basic he manipul them into reproduc and rais their children on hi seed he said that the littl on who look differ were a sub speci meant to provid servic he carefulli comb through histori rewrit it in hi favor pull like a weed anyth that compromis hi control he entic recruit by send them hi vision sai that there wa immort at the end of the road for onli twelv soul kill or be kill the amount of control he could exert wa finit though as at everi chang he made a void would appear in our realiti the univers on dai end 100 meter from us it seem odd but we couldn t rememb how els it should be then some of the twelv were no more final when he could prune no more and realiti stop just beyond hi fingertip he step through hi portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he had creat i made a few more chang and lost my bodi exist onli on the wind moral it veri possibl to elimin from your realiti the soul whose will s ar not in harmoni with your

to the past onc here the on who look like us sell ride he can make you a princ or a queen or you can live as a god in ancient greec go ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like adam henri i hope you like inspect your sock care though if he like your work but think you re get wise he can direct you to cross path with your old self and you ll vanish as you rewrit your own cours of histori none the wiser as we pass the point along the parallel line where he step back in time hi hierarchi will lose it direct he can still make chang while he s here it just that that is work and with everi

all of their time to bui back a tenth of what thei produc have we been deceiv if we ar more effici why is it get harder to get by what if the point is just to keep the peopl busi make widget in that other realiti i shout to the twelv it chao thei said no it order he defin chao as that which is he wa not abl to control rain forest the problem could be that all the water in it canopi would hide the locat of an indigen peopl who have no languag telepath and vanish the closest knowledg of death think of the spine as a transceiv if it is on the ground and point up you can locat it from abov these peopl ar probabl naiv as children but veri veri tough to kill also thei should be abl to tell you stori about the dark on that i talk about thei can hear him i think that ham and world band radio old timer might have a stori to tell on thi these peopl would be on a differ frequenc than us as thei aren t eat seed famin relief when i make my diet almost all whole wheat i get a huge belli lose muscl

there ar exampl of thi practic in the aquat mammal kingdom to investig that gui is the master of illus and the ultim liar he tell it first and then just follow the thread of time in which the peopl ar

that he ha laid that is that he wa right and he didn t over plai hi hand and he won t need to go back and try anoth thread of time you have ultim control over your destini just don t live along a path that lead to a realiti in which you don t want to be a part of i don t claim to be the first to think these thing it just that the other could have been prune from our path mayb these thought given to
