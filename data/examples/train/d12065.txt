in sci electron idh nessi mcc ac uk ian hawkin write when construct activ filter odd valu of resistor ar often requir i e someth like a 3 14 k ohm resistor it seem best to choos common capacitor valu and cope with the strang resist then demand is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resist given fix resistor of the standard 12 valu per decad 1 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 2 3 3 etc it is a common enough problem yet i cant recal se a program that tell that rx ry rz give rq start with q and find prefer valu x y and z sinc you re worri about the third decim place i assum you re us 1% toler resistor and capacitor
