mr decenso in spite of requir scholarli opinion on the hang of juda reject that the scholarli opinion of the those scholar and then rephras those scholar opinion on the subject we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and act probabl record hi death although it s possibl and plausibl that he fell from the hang and hit some rock therebi burst open i can no longer assum that to be the case therefor no contradict matthew did not sai juda di as a result of the hang did he most scholar believ he iprob did but i quot all that to show that i highli regard the scholar explan but in look at the text initi we can t assum juda di it is howev highli probabl and also there is noth in the greek to suggest success or failur it simpli mean hang oneself actual if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it doe denot success those scholar did inde have an excel reason to assum that the suicid wa success as i point out i recent check sever lexicon greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word studi concord tynsdal a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other earli christian write bauer arndt gingrich the new analyt greek lexicon perschbach a coupl simpli state hang oneself and a coupl were more explicit and state that apacgw mean specif kill yourself by hang a coupl also note that the mean of on the root word for apacgw is strangl throttl or choke which pretti much invalid the gui who suggest to david joslin that juda wa hung upsid down on of the best refer though robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament not onli state the translat it gave both the root word the liter translat relat greek word which us the same root and also other present specif exampl of the word in greek literatur to give further context the word apagchw ha two root word gchw is the to strangl root and the root word apo mean liter awai thi root word is includ in word which denot a transit it can mean a transit in place eg the greek word apagello mean to send a messag apo can also denot a chang in state and specif the chang from life to death robinson specif make comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to kill in liter mean the word apacgw mean to throttl strangl to put out of the wai and implicitli denot a chang in life state ie awai from life to death so while the word apacgw doe mean to hang it specif denot a death as well thu robinson is quit specif when he state that it mean to hang oneself to end on s life by hang he then note the the us of apacgw in homer odessi 19 230 to denot context he present that exampl of apacgw as be us to explicitli mean suicid by hang now sinc there is a perfectli good word for strangl without the ad denot of death and as you insist that the bibl wa written by god and everi word is precic correct you ar stuck with the complet mean of apacgw ie sinc the word apacgw wa us then death is denot as the result by the wai i note that mr decenso also present an exampl of apacgw in the septuagint the greek translat of the ot us at the time of jesu it s onli us in 2 samuel 17 23 now when ahithophel saw that hi advic wa not follow he saddl a donkei and aros and went home to hi hous to hi citi then he put hi household in order and hang himself and di and he wa buri in hi father s tomb notic that not onli is it state that ahithophel hang himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitli add and di here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we ar not explicitli told juda di note mr decenso as you sai the septuagint wa a translat from hebrew to greek and you have not shown the origin mean of the hebrew ie the the hebrew sai and di and thu whether it wa simpli echo in the greek it should also be point out that regardless of the ad and di the correct translat would still be apacgw as the man did inde die from strangul redund but correct further we have evid that the septuagint wa repeatedli rewritten and reedit which includ version which contradict each other and such edit wa not even necessarili execut by greek thu i am not sure that you can us the septuagint as it now stand as a paragon of ancient greek so what you realli need to prove your point mr decenso is an exampl in ancient greek of someon commit apacgw and surviv otherwis i would see you as simpli make worthless assert without correspond evid now i would note mr decenso that everytim i go out of my wai to research it on of your appar contriv exegisi i pretti much find it fals thu i think that if you ar go to add to the text someth over and abov what the sourc clearli sai then you had better have an explicit greek or histor sourc to justifi it by the wai as to mr rose s statement about tree around the potter s field there ar still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom unless mr rose can show that these tree ar two thousand year old or that there ar 2000 year old stump there or ha a 2 thousand year old descript of the area which mention such tree then it is inappropri for him to assert that the present placement of tree prove the locat of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing chang now as to your other argument ie that the monei juda us is not the same as the 30 silver as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the monei with which juda purchas the land wa inde for the betray rather than some other sourc i would point out that in act where it specif mention the reward of iniqu act 1 18 it also specif mention what act of iniqu thei were talk about ie act 1 16 concern juda who wa guid to those who arrest jesu now i would point out that when the bibl describ an act of iniqu and then immedi discuss the reward of iniqu it would be rather inan to suggest that it wa an action of iniqu other than the on discuss notic that in vers 16 the word iniqu is not us rather it state that juda becam a guid to those who arrest jesu but the writer did not stop there vs 17 for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministri what part did juda plai in their ministri true peter or the author of act doe not specif call juda betray an iniqu but for that matter neither doe john specif call juda action an iniqu either further john 13 29 did not sai that juda took the monei box but rather said some thought that becaus juda had the monei box jesu wa tell him bui what we need for the feast or that he should give someth to the poor so after receiv the morsel he immedi went out and it wa night note that it is said that juda left it doe not sai that he took the monei box thu when i see your explan it still seem to me you would choos the a an unproven iniqu mention by anoth author in a differ book written at a differ time over the iniqu explicitli mention by the author of act i find thi forc and contriv of cours thi particular argument becom moot sinc we have have seen evid that apacgw mean suicid you see sinc juda hang wa success he could not have spent the monei mention in john 13 29 becaus matthew and mark explicitli sai the betray wa on the high holi dai ie passov and thu he could not have spent the monei befor kill himself the next dai thu the monei which bought the field of blood would have to have been the 30 piec of silver of cours he got the 30 piec of silver that night as well and thu couldn t have spent that either oh dear i believ that the hous of card is com down mayb we should at thi point discuss now whether jesu wa crucifi on fridai or saturdai as that is now part of the argument about juda by the wai as to where the prophesi of the potter s field came from ie the mention of it in matthew you sai pleas when we ar done with thi studi on hi death remind me to discuss thi with you i am remind you now to discuss it now it s all part of the same vers we ar discuss and i wish you would quit procrastin and sidestep these issu later dave butler a wise man proport hi belief to the evid david hume philosoph an inquiri concern human understand ps i would note again that you ar not state that that bibl is not possibl inerr you ar state that it is inerr sinc you have been by your own admiss present mere possibl reconcili i of cours don t rate them that highli then the best you can do is sai that the bibl is possibl inerr not that it is inerr
