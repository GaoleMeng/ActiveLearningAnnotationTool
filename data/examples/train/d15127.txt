boswel 5 wherea the usual translat 6 of thi term give it either explicitli or implicitli an activ sens boswel give it a passiv sens in an extend discuss of the term 341 53 he cite linguist evid and common sens to support hi conclus that the word mean male sexual agent i e activ male prostitut hi argument is that the arseno part of the word is adjectiv not the object of the koitai which refer to base sexual activ henc the term accord to boswel design a male sexual person or male prostitut he acknowledg howev that most interpret the composit term as activ mean those who sleep with make their
