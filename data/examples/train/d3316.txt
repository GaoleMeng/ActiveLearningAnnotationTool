dean j falcion post from jrmst 8 pitt edu write i wrote when the pen got mario grant there wa big public etc etc and interest wa immedi gener gretzki did the same thing for la howev imnsho neither team would have seen a mark improv in attend if the team record did not improv in the year befor lemieux came pittsburgh finish with 38 point follow hi arriv the pen finish with 53 76 72 81 87 72 88 and 87 point with a coupl of stanlei cup thrown in it wa at thi point the pen attend wa near capac 34 out of 40 sellout yet thei hadn t made the playoff sinc 1982 how do you explain a 6th place team break attend record when thei haven t been to the playoff in 7 year mario lemieux is the explan imho you could make a case that the expect of an improv team that would make the playoff is the reason funni you should mention it thi is exactli the case i wa go to make but i think the reason is lemieux had a 168 point season and wa the first non gretzki to win the hart and ross sinc 1980 peopl turn out to watch him plai i will grant that a star like mario will draw fan even if the team suck but thi is short term onli i still do not think the attend increas will last unless the team is a win competit improv butt kick on pittsburgh wa still get better so peopl continu to support them if thei suddenli drop to sai 50 point you d have knee surgeri for some of the peopl jump off the bandwagon also the follow year 88 89 the pen had 89 point not 87 ok my number came from the nhl guid and record book thei made the transact to try and build a winner around mario that is true but the improv in attend came befor thei start do thi coffei late in 1987 and befor thei even had a playoff bound team a doubl of attend occur in 1984 85 from the previou year an increas from 38 point to 53 point is not go to do that the arriv of mario lemieux is what did it you can give the credit to mario sinc he deserv it but my point is that it wasn t mario himself but it wa the expect of thing to come i e a win team that he creat by be the next great hockei superstar and befor anybodi jump in and sai i m nit pick and minc word go back and read from where thi thread start it might help to think about what would go through a fan s mind who suddenli found an interest in mario and the pen wa it gee mario lemieux is amaz i ll go watch him plai or wa it gee now we ve got a kick ass gui on our side i ll go watch him plai i think it wa the latter similar thing happen in l a befor gretzki s arriv about 12000 per game after constant sellout thei ar still sell out everi game despit show littl or no improv sinc gretzki s first year there how do you explain it peopl ar go to see gretzki thei certainli aren t go to see a winner thei haven t got a winner thei ve had much better team in their past histori than thei current have yet thei didn t draw as well then i don t think thi is accur the ticket sell but peopl don t go to the game i think thi thread ha alreadi been discuss season ticket holder in la don t alwai us their ticket so in effect after the king initi success follow gretzki s arriv 68 to 91 point same sourc and correspond attend jump there ha been an effect drop in attend even though ticket sale mai not have chang much whether or not the king ar a winner is debat i claim that sinc gretzki s arriv thei have at the veri least been competit i also claim that mcnall ha made a stupid move in try to reassembl the oiler dynasti but that s anoth stori and includ onli becaus i don t like mcnall anywai mcnall did do some heavi market around gretzki and that undoubtedli wa also respons for the attend and merchandis sale etc but as i said when the king have been in there littl tailspin over the past coupl of year there have been empti seat at the forum even if the ticket were sold i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzki the player can transcend win as the major draw power for the short term imo although i think that it s inevit that the team will improv with a player such as lemieux or gretzki simpli becaus thei make peopl around them better but win sure as hell help well at least we ar in full agreement here thi doe not make roger s point ani more valid but the jet aren t so ar you sai roger ha ever had a valid point couldn t resist get a huge jump in product yet thei ar get a huge jump in attend thi is due to the emerg of teemu selann thei have the 17th best record in hockei it sure as hell isn t becaus thei ar win ye but thei ar do no wors than last year i think the same type of reason i appli to a new pittsburgh fan appli to all the extra peopl show up at winnipeg game it s difficult to predict but do you think that if the jet miss the playoff next season that in the year after thei will maintain their attend level i serious doubt it becaus in that case the expect of an improv team would be gone with or without selann i did provid the exampl of rocket ismail and the toronto argonaut of the cfl did you leav it out becaus you don t know much about the cfl if that s the case then fair enough but if it isn t the case then i m curiou to hear your explan
