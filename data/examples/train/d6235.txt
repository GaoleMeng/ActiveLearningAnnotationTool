from articl c68ubg k2w world std com by cfw world std com christoph f wroten i have an eisa machin and i just do not understand why most eisa video card onli match the perform of their isa counterpart for instanc the eisa orchid pro design ii e is onli about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plu which isn t what i would call fast i don t understand why eisa video card aren t as a group on the same level of perform as local bu card given that eisa video card have a 32 bit bu to move data around instead of isa s 8 bit good question answer the eisa bu doe move 32 bit rather than isa s 8 16 but it still move it at about the speed as the isa bu i think that s either 8 or 10 mhz the local bu design also move 32 bit like the eisa but thei move the data at the cpu speed up to 40 mhz so on a 33mhz cpu the local bu is move 32bit data at 33 mhz and the eisa is move 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz so the local bu should be 3 to 4 time faster than eisa on a 33 mhz cpu eisa should be about two mayb 3 time as fast as isa sinc thei ar not why would anyon me includ pai a higher cost for a eisa video card when it perform is no better than and often wors that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar 24x from pc magazin s i think recent report i know that ati make a pretti fast eisa video card but it s around $500 which is just about doubl what my wallet will allow me to spend and for $500 i could get a diamond viper and still have $100 left over of cours i d have to get a local bu mother board too that s a veri good question the eisa bu doe have more advantag over the isa bu than just it s width for exampl more better interrupt and bu master but these other factor do not impact a video card veri much thei have more impact on file server with multipl hard drive full throttl network card cd rom etc can anyon shed some light on my confus frustrat thank christoph wroten cfw world std com
