darren dr nanci s sweeti kilroi gboro rowan edu write darren in an earlier articl i explain that what mani peopl find darren arrog about christian is that some christian profess darren absolut certainti about their belief and doctrin and darren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sourc darren ar if ani part of your doctrin or belief rest on your own darren think and reason then those doctrin ar suspect the point that darren rais is a veri lutheran viewpoint while reason is a gift from god it is also infect by sin yet we do not reject reason entir and neither i think doe darren we need reason as darren himself ha point out to comprehend god s revel of himself in the bibl but reason alon is not suffici to comprehend and believ the word we need first and foremost faith for the sin mind is hostil to god it doe not submit to god s law nor can it do so roman 8 7 luther accept scriptur as the sole mean of revel sola scriptura but accept the necess of the us of reason with faith in comprehend that revel yet luther also said regard baptism but mad reason rush forth and becaus baptism is not dazzl like the work which we do regard it as worthless larg catech fourth part baptism to make matter more complic luther wa the sort of theologian that mani peopl would describ as an absolutist i ve seen him describ as a take no prison theologian we might conclud given these observ that luther wa inconsist or mad and sure at least some have come to that conclus but it might be us to recal that jesu wa also call mad and peter felt compel to defend himself and the apostl against a charg of drunken on pentecost so we as christian ought to be care about reject luther or other as mad rather we should imit the berean who examin the scriptur everi dai to see if what paul said wa true act 17 11 the basi for the confid with which luther peter paul and mani other preach the gospel wa not just reason but faith and the holi spirit thi is not faith divorc from reason but a faith that guid inform and us reason the spirit enabl us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldli god doe not want us to preach the messag that i think that jesu might have risen from the dead but rather i know that my redeem live job 19 25 the christian doe not side with pilat in sai what is truth but rather follow christ who said in fact for thi reason i wa born and for thi i came into the world to testifi to the truth everyon on the side of truth listen to me john 18 37 we can know the truth becaus god ha promis us that we can know the truth jesu said if you hold to my teach you ar realli my discipl then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john 8 31 32 the proverb urg us bui the truth and do not sell it pr 23 23 the psalmist prai do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps 119 43 evid he believ that the word of truth wa in fact in hi mouth yet we do inde appear arrog if our claim to the truth is motiv by self glorif but if we present the truth as the teach of scriptur reveal by the spirit and not our own invent and if we stand readi to be prove wrong on the basi of scriptur as luther did then we ar not arrog but humbl we should humbl trust in god s promis of truth just as we trust in hi promis of forgiv rexlex it is onli becaus of god s own revel that we can be rexlex absolut about a thing darren but how far doe that get you onc god s revel stop darren and your own reason begin possibl for error appear i agre that we must make a distinct between the clear teach of scriptur and the product of our own reason even when such reason is base on scriptur howev i think i would draw the line of distinct more reason and less academ than you would darren for exampl let s suppos that our modern bibl translat darren includ a perfect render of jesu word at the last supper darren and that jesu said exactli thi is my bodi darren we ll presum that what he said wa total without error and darren absolut true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stop speak and peopl start darren interpret the possibl of error appear did he mean darren that liter or not we do not have ani record that he darren elabor on the word wa he think of tran or con darren substanti he didn t sai darren is almost at the point of make a veri lutheran statement about the lord s supper the lutheran approach is to sai that if jesu said thi is my bodi then that is what we should believ other interpret ar reject simpli becaus thei ar not taught in scriptur recal that jesu word do not stand alon on thi subject we also have paul s word in 1 corinthian 11 17 34 in which he pass on to us what he receiv from the lord in particular he said for whenev you eat thi bread and drink thi cup you proclaim the lord s death until he come by these word we should believ that the bread that we eat in the lord s supper realli is bread as well as the lord s bodi as our sens in fact tell us doe thi prove that tran substanti is fals i suppos someon could sai that paul spoke metaphor of the lord s bodi as bread simpli becaus that is the wai the bodi appear when we eat it but thi thought is found nowher in scriptur so we reject it thu the primari reason for reject tran substanti is not that we can prove it fals but that it is simpli not found in scriptur side remark i ve been told that the lutheran doctrin on real presenc is con substanti but it ha been non lutheran who have told me thi we tend not to us the word i almost think that thi is us more by professor of compar religion who need label to compar cathol lutheran and reform teach on the lord s supper but almost everi church want to call their own teach real presenc becaus that wa the tradit teach of the church end side remark darren when christian speak as if thei believ their own reason darren can never lead them astrai when we implicitli claim that we darren ar infal the non christian around us rare believ darren that implicit claim wit is hardli go to work when darren the person you ar talk to believ that you ar either too darren foolish to recognis your own limit or intention try darren to cover them up thi is precis why christian should not reli on ration in their wit it is far better to take the approach i d like to show you what scriptur sai you decid for yourself whether to believ it or not darren rexlex suggest that peopl read _he is there and he is not darren silent_ by franci schaeffer i didn t think veri highli of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossli overr by mani darren evangel christian somebodi els might like it though darren so don t let my opinion stop you from read it darren if someon is interest in my opinion i d suggest _on darren certainti_ by ludwig wittgenstein as long as we re trade refer i d like to suggest dr siegbert becker s paperback the foolish of god the place of reason in lutheran theologi publish by northwestern publish hous thi book wa base on becker s doctor thesi at the univers of chicago david wagner
