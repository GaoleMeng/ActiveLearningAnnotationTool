about a year ago i start work on a problem that appear to be veri simpl and turn out to be quit difficult i am wonder if anyon on the net ha seen thi problem and hopefulli some publish solut to it the problem is to draw an outlin of a surfac defin by two roughli parallel cubic spline for input the problem essenti start with two set of point where each set of point is on the edg of an object which we treat as two dimension i e onli extant between the edg but which exist in three dimension space to draw the object we 1 fit a cubic spline through the point each spline is effect comput as a sequenc of line segment approxim the curv each spline ha an equal number of segment we assum that the nth segment along each spline is roughli but not exactli the same distanc along each spline by ani reason measur 2 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the oppos spline us the pair of segment to form two triangl which will be fill in to color the surfac 3 depth sort the triangl 4 take each triangl in sort order project onto a 2d pixmap draw and color the triangl take the edg of the triangl that is along the edg of the surfac and draw a line along that edg color with a special edg color it is the edg color in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effect outlin the edg of the surfac the net result howev gener ha lot of break and gap in the edg of the surfac the reason for thi ar fairli complic thei involv both raster problem and problem result from the project the spline if anyth about thi problem sound familiar we would appreci know about other work in thi area thank
