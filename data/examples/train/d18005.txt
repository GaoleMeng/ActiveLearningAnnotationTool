to try to post to it i sure hope that matt also read either a f r l or t p m saw it in t p m thank in articl c5qk7t 2qk voder nsc com matt galaxi nsc com matt freivald x8043 said i like to call the form of govern that i advoc fractal feder with fractal feder there is a repres nation govern that ha onli certain limit power to do what is absolut necessari at that level next there ar the state govern again with onli absolut necessari power onward to counti citi township district and neighborhood 1 the lowest read most local level ar the on that have the most power over individu dai to dai live which is good becaus that is the level where individu have the most voic you know if you take all thi to it logic conclus doesn t it seem that the _real_ lowest level the level where individu have the most voic is that of the singl individu themselv why have you omit that level from your model ye and the individu is not omit i just didn t fulli articul the principl of fractal feder all govern power deriv from the peopl each level can receiv a new power from the level below through the amend process where a true consensu sai a 3 4 major write that power into the constitut of the level abov in the case of the lowest level an amend is pass by a 3 4 major vote in the case of higher level it must be pass by 3 4 of the legislatur we can of cours haggl about the specif of true consensu when we hold our constitut convent onc a power ha been grant it mai be exercis by the legislatur power not in the origin constitut must percol upward start from the individu the ratif process for the origin constitut should involv consensu and not simpli a plural or major grant a right in a constitut is of cours the same as empow the govern at that level to restrict the activ of the govern at the lower level so it oper in the same wai as the amend process again that crazi resembl to the suppos but not actual u s govern structur thi govern structur is a veri frustrat on for those peopl read liber who would like to have concentr power to us the govern to forc peopl to do good a difficult to defin word and on that it is difficult to reach a consensu on it is also a frustrat structur for those who want to us the govern to dictat person behavior read big govern conserv i person would rather see those type of peopl frustrat than the incred eros of liberti both civil and econom that is go on now thi is imho a good govern stuctur for those who see the role of govern as the protect of individu liberti while still recogn that individu need to have some influenc in the type of commun that thei live in 2 a free market work on govern not just econom succes idea propog unsuccess idea die what is your definit of a success idea or a success govern on which maintain peac liberti and the opportun for happi for it peopl while work within the realiti of human natur you do bring up the point intent or not that a last idea is by no mean necessarili a success idea i believ that fractal feder would at least bring mani idea to light and the peopl would have the opportun to democrat choos between good idea and bad idea if the docialist er i mean democrat ar right and govern activ foster a prosper peopl thei will have a plethora of local opportun to check their thesi if libertopia is possibl it will aris if a balanc conserv republ is democrat receiv as the best level of govern activ it will becom clear to the peopl that it is best as far as set the moral tone is concern if a commun doe not collect want to put up with prostitut go on in front of their kid why should thei have to if a commun doe not want to see prolifer of drug among their kid why should thei have to for the same reason that thei have to put up with a church oper right out in the open where their kid can see it and with the owner of the hous across the street fly an american flag right out there in the open everi dai in front of their kid it s call freedom if thei don t like the idea to which their kid ar expos thei can try to educ and persuad their kid as to why the thing that thei re see other peopl do ar wrong or bad right and peopl would not rescind ani freedom read empow the govern except through the amend process that is how the feder govern is suppos to work now but the suprem soviet er i mean the suprem court put a stop to that republican govern nonsens in my hypothet govern if there were a constitut provis empow the govern to regul church the govern whatev level we ar talk about could inde ban church the constitut provis would be invalid if a higher level had a constitut provis protect free exercis of religion the uppermost constitut is still the suprem law of the land i find it interest that you applaud the idea of free market competit among variou idea and yet support the right of he major in a commun to suppress idea which thei don t like it is a matter of individu be abl to control their own associ and environ not a matter of suppress of idea on dilemma of the human condit is that individu need liberti and thei also need to have some control over their environ in my fractal feder govern certain right ar protect by the constitut other right ar protect simpli becaus the govern ha not been empow to infring upon them when a consensu is reach that the govern should have a certain power then freedom is infring upon thi cannot be avoid murder statut infring upon freedom but i think that the consensu of the american peopl is that murder statut ar a good idea i am sure that mani parent believ that thei have a right to control the environ that their children live in peopl feel that thei have a right to sleep peacefulli at night thu there ar nois ordin there ar zone law that keep busi from overrun residenti neighborhood i do not view these as bad thing certainli some individu instanc ar bad but the concept is not necessarili bad i view them as the peopl in a commun have some control over the type of commun that thei live in i see the altern as near anarchi like i said in anoth post if you can come up with a scenario where an individu can do someth truli autonom with absolut zero effect on anyon els then no individu or govern ha the right to restrict that activ there ar simpli not veri mani behavior that fit into the categori of the truli autonom so the whole thing becom an issu of on individu or group have power over anoth individu or group i think that the fractal feder approach is a sound if not ideal approach to limit thi restrict power the libertarian scenario degener to might make right and the system we have right now is on of lawyer abus natur right philosophi to decid what power the govern should have by subvert the democrat process though the suprem court the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tri to deni the fundament dilemma of democrat govern the peopl have a right to exercis a voic in their commun yet individu have the right to be left to themselv thi is a seriou dilemma precis becaus there is not much that take place in a vacuum oddli enough if what you sai is taken liter there is littl or no conflict the peopl do inde have a right to exercis a voic where voic equal persuas speech in their commun it s onli when thei somehow get the idea into their head that thei also have a right to dictat behavior in their commun that the troubl begin i think i answer thi abov alreadi but let me expand a littl more with an exampl if i stand nake in front of your hous and masturb in front of your children while thei plai in your libertarian small l scenario the onli recours you have is to yell at me autonom is a valu judgement 99 99% of the time it is not a scientif realiti with a clear definit exactli who would you empow to make that valu judgement stuff delet certainli not the onli caus mike but peopl in a local neighborhood should have a voic in what goe on in that neighborhood to deni thi is to creat anoth concentr central power to keep the local from abus it power in essenc us a pit bull to keep a toi poodl from bite your leg chanc ar the pit bull is go to turn on you some dai and you have much less defens against it than you do against the toi poodl the argument here appear to be that tyranni of the individu by the local major is superior to have the feder govern have and exercis the power to protect the individu from hi neighbor becaus that feder govern will eventu and inevit becom corrupt and us it power to tyrann everyon okai there s a lot of truth in that certainli we re see someth like that happen in the unit state todai though it s unclear that he progress here match the model sinc our belov and benign feder govern hasn t _ever_shown much enthusiasm for the idea of protect ani individu lot of peopl ar long on complaint and short on practic solut although i am pessimist that my idea will ever bear fruit i am at least try to be long on solut also i am truli interest if you have ani improv to make on my idea i call them my idea but thei all come from an averag gui read of the u s constitut without benefit of the indoctrin of constitut law academia but i have to sai that i think that your solut is at least just as bad trade the yoke of feder tyranni for the yoke of local tyranni doesn t cheer me up much i think i d prefer to put my faith in a larger govern that at least _might_ protect the individu from time to time rather than place it in local mob rule admittedli it s the lesser of two evil and it s not less by veri much and thei re both pretti damn evil sorri the confus wa my fault when i said that fractal feder resembl the u s constitut i meant it and thought it wa pretti clear i should have more clearli explain that the ultim deriv of govern power is from the consensu of the peopl although not the consent of everi individu a practic observ not a moral judgement it is certainli better than have all govern power deriv from nine lawyer which is the situat we have now that is why i think the suprem court should be a juri court with a differ juri for each case it is certainli not perfect no philosophi of govern is but do you still find it a repugn idea if so what is your solut ideal everyon would leav everyon els alon and no govern coerciv power of ani kind would be necessari thi will never work becaus peopl ar differ and by their natur thei will alwai want to forc their view on other if thi were not the case nobodi would try to forc their view that murder is wrong on anyon els thi is true the question is what we you go to do about it your propos solut seem to actual _encourag_ these bozo to lord it over their victim i think that you misunderstood the structur of the form of govern i advoc and it wa my fault for not be more clear oh and by the wai liborg think is irrelev integr is irrelev free speech is irrelev privat properti is irrelev person respons is irrelev conservativ is futil you will be assimil how much would freedom of speech or privat properti right be respect in a commun in which the major wa allow to make all the rule that man s sai thing in public that i don t want my children expos to let s shut him up those homo ar live togeth and fornic in that hous over there let s run em outta town the major doe not make the rule the major or possibl a plural simpli elect repres to exercis limit govern power those limit govern power deriv from a larg consensu not a simpl major and the feder govern in my scenario still ha the power to protect freedom william decemb starr wdstarr athena mit edu matt freivald liborg think is irrelev integr is irrelev free speech is irrelev privat properti is irrelev person respons is irrelev conservativ is futil you will be assimil these ar my opinion onli and not those of my employ
