jbrown batman bmd trw com write i don t regret the fact that sometim militari decis have to be made which affect the live of innoc peopl but i do regret the circumst which make those decis necessari and i regret the suffer caus by those decis i m afraid i m go to have to kill you don t worri though as a love christian i guarante that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you although i won t regret the actual kill if we hadn t interven allow hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeas right but did you ever hear anyon advoc such a cours of action or ar you just set up a strawman i m not set up a strawman at all if you want to argu against the war then the onli logic altern wa to allow hussein to keep kuwait fals dichotomi diplomat altern includ sanction were ineffect that s becaus thei weren t even attempt but what about those who didn t support hitler s dream of conquest it s not as if thei democrat vote for all hi polici the nsdap got 43 % in the elect of 1933 and that wa the last chanc the german peopl got to vote on the matter thei suffer along with the rest why doe thi bother you so much you want to know why it bother me that thousand of innoc peopl were maim or kill by bomb at the end of ww2 when it wa far from clear that such bomb wa necessari the world is full of evil and circumst ar not perfect mani innoc suffer due to the wrong action of other it it regret but that s the wai it is and why is it that wai who set thing up to be that wai thi wa happen befor the gulf war why didn t we send in the bomber to east timor why aren t we send in the bomber now probabl becaus we re not the savior of the world we can t polic each and everi countri that decid to self destruct or invad anoth no just the on that have oil or the on that look like thei might make a success of commun nor ar we in a strateg posit to get relief to tibet east timor or some other place i don t see that get un forc to east timor is ani harder than get them to iraq tibetan peopl ar round up tortur and execut amnesti intern recent report that tortur is still widespread in china why aren t we stop them in fact why ar we activ suck up to them by trade freeli with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for on do not agre with the present us polici of suck up to them as you put it i agre that it is deplor fine write to your congressman and to presid clinton china s statu as most favour nation come up for renew in june point out that the us shouldn t be offer favour trade term to such a despic regim i doubt anyth will happen clinton s keener on trade sanction against europ unbeliev comment about the rodnei king case delet the media is not total monolith even though there is a prevail liber bia program such as the macneil lehrer new hour try to give a balanc and fair report of the new there ar even conserv sourc out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush ani idea how mani kill file you just end up in i an atheist am argu against kill innoc peopl you a suppos christian ar argu that it s ok to kill innoc peopl so long as you get some guilti on as well hardli i didn t sai that it s a good thing tm to kill innoc peopl if the end is just unfortun we don t live in a perfect world and there ar no perfect solut if on is go to resist tyranni then innoc peopl on both side ar go to suffer and die i didn t sai it is ok it is unfortun but sometim necessari the end justifi the mean eh you have criticis moral relativ in the past ar now argu that i am in no posit to judg the moral of alli action at the end of the war you certainli ar not in such a posit if you ar a moral relativist the same tire old misunderstand moral relativ mean that there is no object standard of moral it doesn t mean you can t judg other peopl s moral christ on a bike how mani time have we tri to hammer that into your head where s your christian love where s your absolut moral oh how quick you ar to discard them when it suit you as ivan stang would sai jesu would puke on dai i will stand befor jesu and give account of everi word and action even thi discours in thi forum i understand the full ramif of that and i am prepar to do so i don t believ that you can make the same claim obvious not as i am an atheist i don t think you d get on with jesu though he wa a long hair lunat peac nik wa he not and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bomb in germani wa becaus you were bemoan the iraqi civilian casualti as be so deplor yet blanket bomb wa institut becaus bomb wasn t accur enough to hit industri militari target in a decis wai by ani other method at that time but in the gulf war precis bomb wa the norm so the point wa why make a big stink about the rel few civilian casualti that result in spite of precis bomb when so mani more civilian proportion and quantit di under the blanket bomb in ww2 right unfortun for you it turn out that my opinion on the matter were entir consist in that i condemn the bomb of dresden too i think you re be a bit glib with your explan of the blanket bomb polici too you make it sound as though we were aim for militari target and could onli get them by destroi civilian build next door as i understand it that is not the case we aim deliber at civilian target in order to caus massiv damag and inspir terror amongst the german peopl civilian suffer but less civilian suffer in thi war than ani other iani other in histori oh come on with war like the falkland fresh in peopl s mind that sort of propaganda isn t go to fool anyon the stori of hundr of thousand of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk ye bunk the us lost 230 000 servicemen in ww2 over four year and the major of them were directli involv in fight ye and what about the million of casualti the russian suffer it s hardli surpris the us didn t lose mani men in ww2 given that you turn up late mathew
