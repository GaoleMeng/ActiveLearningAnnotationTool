dear fellow christian i had a dinner last night with a bibl studi group which i am in we had a discuss about the differ between christian and islam and i wa shock to hear that our bibl studi teacher said that mohammad wa inde a prophet but of satan i said what i did not believ that becaus i have some moslem friend who ar so kind and nice even sometim i feel i wish i could be like them in my point of view thei don t sin as much as i do how come if thei were under satan thei could have such person to tell you the truth i don t know much about islam but i know that thei believ in god thei believ in the dai of judgement now i m ask you what your opinion about islam and it teach import i do not want to discuss whether thei ar save or not i do not want to discuss about polit relat to islam p s i post thi in bit listserv christia soc religion christian and bit listserv cathol in christ our lord smile jesu love you tabut torsina torsina enuxhb ea asu edu let me start by sai that thi is not the right newsgroup for a discuss of islam sinc there s a group for that but i suspect the point your teacher wa make wa not specif about islam inde it s go to be imposs to see what he wa get at within your groundrul sinc the question of whether non christian ar save is at the heart of it the classic christian view which i think most peopl believ until the last centuri or so wa that christian and of cours judaism wa the onli religion found by god and that all other religion worship fals god and came from satan thi is more or less a corollari of anoth tradit view that no on but christian and possibl jew will be save thi need not mean that there s no truth in ani other religion nor that all of their member ar intention satan after all in order to be an effect snare satan altern would have to be attract thu thei might contain all kind of truth wisdom and spiritu insight thei would be miss onli on thing knowledg of salvat through christ if thi is the background of your teacher s remark and i suspect it is that mean that a discuss of islam is not necessarili relev the point is not that there s anyth intrins wrong with it it mai teach a fine code of behavior and it practition mai all be wonder peopl but if salvat requir be a follow of christ it could still be a satan invent thi is a reason deduct from the classic protest posit christian sai that salvat isn t a matter of be kind and nice those ar good thing and we should encourag them but no on is abl to do them enough to be save salvat requir christ pleas forgiv me for do thi in protest term there s a cathol equival to thi that ha similar implic but in differ term a religion mai be quit attract in all visibl wai but if it doesn t have christ it s like a diet that consist of food that look wonder tast great but is miss some essenti food element so that you end up dy let me be clear that i am not specif advoc thi posit what i m try to do is as usual to clarifi issu inde it is now rel uncommon for christian to believ that all other religion ar satan most christian regard such belief as an unfortun vestig of the past thi is part of a gener move within christian in the last centuri or so to a non judgement god christian now find it hard to believ that god would allow anybodi other than a realli rotten person to end up in hell and thei find it hard to envis that real malign spiritu forc ar at work in the world do thing like creat superfici attract altern to christian whether there is actual a sound basi for the shift is a decis that peopl need to make for themselv clh
