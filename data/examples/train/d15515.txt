jek cu nih gov jame kiefer write stuff delet first point what thei ar do is wrong just as what joseph s brother did wa wrong just as what juda did wa wrong thei intend it for evil if god somehow bring good out of it that doe not make them ani less subject to just condemn and punish second point of cours god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbian had refrain from the sin of robberi and rape and murder nor doe the good he purpos excus us from the duti of do what is right so what you re sai then is that god exercis direct control or influenc upon human he doesn t control our everi thought or action but take what we do whether it be intend for evil or not and turn it into someth good it seem to me that thi idea conflict with the belief that god gave human free will as far as i can determin it is imposs to reconcil these two differ idea if god were to exert hi influenc upon anyon or anyth at anytim he would be imped upon someon s free will unless of cours you believ that god did not give us complet and unab free will but rather some sort of condit free will someth that allow us to make our own choic and control our own live except when god want to us us to fulfil some good purpos of hi own by harden our heart or control us in some other wai i hear alot of peopl who look at variou event mostli catastrophi or thing like the aid epidem and make comment about god s will i have a veri difficult time understand why peopl believ that god control anyth that happen on thi planet except possibl when be ask to through someon s prayer accord to the bibl pharoah wa go to let mose peopl go after on or two plagu but god kept harden hi heart so mose could cast all 7 plagu upon the egyptian the last plagu caus the death of mani innoc children so then god imped upon pharoah s free will and us him as a puppet god did thi not just to free the hebrew but to free them in some sort of a grand fashion i suppos from the hebrew s point of view thi could be seen as turn someth bad into good but i m sure the egyptian didn t see it thi wai all of your exampl of how god turn someth bad into someth good ar base upon show favort to on group of peopl over anoth after all it s onli good base upon your point of view why doe god who is suppos to be the god of all of human plai favorit
