mcdonnel dougla roll out dc x huntington beach calif on a pictur perfect southern california dai mcdonnel dougla roll out it dc x rocket ship last saturdai the compani hope thi singl stage rocket technolog demonstr will be the first step toward a singl stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conic vehicl wa schedul to go to the white sand missil rang in new mexico thi week flight test will start in mid june although there wasn t a cloud in the noondai sky the forecast for ssto research remain cloudi the sdi organ which paid $60 million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full develop of a follow on vehicl to get the necessari hundr of million requir for a sub orbit dc xa sdio is pass a tin cup among it sister govern agenc sdio origin fund ssto research as a wai to cut the cost for orbit deploy of space base sensor and weapn howev recent chang in sdi s polit march order and budget cut have made ssto less of a prioriti todai the agenc is more interest in us dc x as a step toward a low cost reusabl sound rocket sdio ha alreadi done 50 brief to other govern agenc said col simon pete worden sdio s deputi for technolog but worden declin to sai how much the agenc would have to poni up for the program i didn t make colonel by tell my contractor how much monei i have avail to spend he quip at a press confer at mcdonnel dougla astronaut headquart while sdio ha lower it sight on the program s orbit object agenc offici hail the dc x as an exampl of the better faster cheaper approach to hardwar develop the agenc believ thi philosophi can produc breakthrough that leapfrog ahead of evolutionari technolog develop worden said the dc x illustr how a build a littl test a littl approach can produc result on time and within budget he said the program which went from concept to hardwar in around 18 month show how todai s engin could move beyond the miracl of our parent time the kei is manag worden said sdio had a veri light hand on thi project we had onli on overwork major jess sponabl although the next phase mai involv more agenc worden said lean manag and a sens of govern industri partnership will be crucial it s essenti we do not end up with a larg manag structur where the price goe up exponenti sdio s approach also won prais from two california member of the hous scienc space and technolog committe thi is the direct we re go to have to go said rep georg brown the committe s democrat chairman program that stretch aout 10 to 15 year aren t sustain nasa hasn t learn it yet sdio ha rep dana rohrbach brown s republican colleagu went further joke that a shrimp is a fish design by a nasa design team rohrbach doubt that the program ever would have been complet if it were left to the civil space agenc rohrbach whose orang counti district includ mcdonnel dougla also critic nasa air forc work on convent multi stage rocket as place new case around old missil technolog let s not build fanci ammunit with capsul on top let s build a spaceship although rohrbach prais sdio s sponsorship he said the privat sector need to take the lead in develop ssto technolog mcdonnel dougla which face veri uncertain prospect with it c 17 transport and space station freedom program were more cautiou about a larg privat secotro commit on veri larg ventur compani put in seed monei said charl ordahl mcdonnel dougla senior vice presid for space system you need strong govern invest while the govern and industri continu to differ on fund for the dc xa thei agre on continu an increment approach to develop cite corpor histori thei liken the process to dougla aircraft s dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft pave the wai for the dc 3 transport a gradual evolut in singl stage rocketri could eventu lead to an orbit delta clipper dc 1 flight test thi summer at white sand will expand the envelop of perform with success test increas speed and altitud the first test will reach 600 feet and demonstr hover verticl take off and land the second seri will send the unman dc x up to 5 000 feet the third and final seri will take the craft up to 20 000 feet maneuv will becom more complex on third phase the final test will includ a pitch over manev that rotat the vehicl back into a bottom down configur for a soft four leg land the flight test seri will be supervis by charl pete conrad who perform similar maneuv on the apollo 12 moon land now a mcdonnel dougla vice presid conrad pais the vehicl aircraft like approach to oper featur includ autom check out and access panel for easi maintain if the program move to the next stage engin technolog will becom a kei consider thi engin would have more thrust than the pratt whitnei rl10a 5 engin us on the dc x each motor us liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propel to gener up to 14 760 pound of thrust base on the engin us in centaur upper stage the a 5 model ha a thrust champer design for sea level oper and three to on throttl capabl it also is design for repeat fire and rapid turnaround worden said futur singl stage rocket could emploi tri propel engin technolog develop in the former soviet union the result engin could burn a dens hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitud the mechan for the team mai alreadi be in place pratt ha a technolog agreement with npo energomash the design bureau respons for the tri propel and energia cryogen engin
