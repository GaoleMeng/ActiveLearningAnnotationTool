the empti tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m smith d d 1894 1977 when jesu wa on earth he made an amaz predict about himself and frequent repeat it let me quot it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrai unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and thei shall condemn him to death and shall deliv him to the gentil to mock and to scourg and to crucifi him and the third dai he shall rise again matthew 20 18 19 wholli differ from the normal experi of men jesu who had never done anyth worthi of death even deserv reprov knew he would die befor he wa 40 year of ag he knew the veri citi where he would die he knew that the religi leader of hi own race would condemn him to death he knew that on of hi own would betrai him he knew that befor hi actual death took place he would be mock and scourg he knew exactli how he would die by crucifixion all thi is in itself remark but more amaz than the minut particular of hi foreknowledg wa what he predict would follow shortli after he wa buri that he would rise again he even design the time on the third dai but sinc it is on thi central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesu christ that the whole truth or untruth of chri tianiti turn let us examin it more close the bodi of jesu wa embalm in long sheet of cloth between the layer of which a great abund of spice and ointment wa distribut the bodi wa place in a tomb which had never befor been us and a great stone wa roll against the entranc the jewish author fulli awar that jesu had predict he would rise again had the stone offici seal and on saturdai place a guard befor the tomb to prevent the discipl from carri awai the bodi earli sundai morn some of the women who were faith follow of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the bodi to their utter astonish thei found the stone roll awai the bodi gone thei rush back to tell the discipl shortli two of jesu friend peter and john utterli skeptic about the whole affair came and found the tomb empti just as the women had said even the guard came hurri into the citi to tell the sanhedrin that had hire them to guard the tomb that the bodi wa gone matthew 28 11 how did thi tomb becom empti on of the most famou new testament scholar in america professor of new testament literatur in a larg theolog seminari wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb becam empti and wrote it in a letter not mark by bitter or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb becam empti than he could explain how santa clau come down the chimnei at christma time but he didn t realiz that santa claus never did come down ani chimnei at christma time becaus there never wa a santa clau and there is a jesu he di he wa buri in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sundai the bodi wa gone those ar fact of histori no on can escap the responsi biliti of come to some conclus about what realli happen by mention a myth we all abandon befor we were eight year old anoth professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard univers tri to explain the empti tomb by sai what no other scholar in the field of new testament critic ha ventur to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the fact ar these first so far as we know there wa no other tomb nearbi to which by mistak thei could have gone second it is contrari to all similar experi for three or more peopl to forget the place where thei have buri their dearest love on within less than three dai even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did thei too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldier guard the wrong tomb there is of cours a record of an attempt to escap the evid of the empti tomb in the new testament itself now when thei were go behold some of the watch came into the citi and show unto the chief priest all the thing that were done and when thei were assembl with the leader and had taken counsel thei gave larg monei unto the soldier sai sai ye hi discipl came by night and stole him awai while we slept and if thi come to the governor s ear we will persuad him and secur you so thei took the monei and did as thei were taught and thi sai is com monli report among the jew until thi dai matthew 28 11 15 thi is a good illustr of mani later attempt to escap the fact that the tomb wa empti you will notic at onc that the chief priest and the elder never question but that the tomb wa empti thei never even went out to see if what the guard had report wa true thei knew it wa true anoth fact about thi stori make it ridicul to maintain that the tomb wa empti the soldier were told to sai that jesu discipl came and stole the bodi awai while thei the soldier were asleep how could thei know what wa go on while thei were asleep obvious such testimoni would be valueless in ani court even asid from the shallow and sordid that make us reject the explan the veri charact and the later histori of the discipl compel us to believ thei did not steal and secretli carri awai the bodi of jesu first as professor heffern point out the leader of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesu to death had noth to offer to contradict these discipl as thei continu to preach jesu and hi resurrect becaus all jerusalem knew the tomb wa empti if there had been trickeri here sooner or later it would have been suspect then prove second sure on of the discipl even most of them would have confess the fraud under the terrif persecut thei underw it mai be possibl to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did the result ultim would have been that the messag that christ had risen would have suffer the fate of all such unfound stori it would have lost it power instead thi truth swept the world close pagan templ won million of discipl brought hope to a despair human wa the veri foundat truth of the earli church and is todai as believ and as freshli gloriou as ever but not onli did jesu come aliv again he did not disappear to leav the discipl specul through all the subsequ dai as to what had happen to him instead he appear to them liter visibl frequent he appear to the women at the tomb on resurrect morn matthew 28 1 10 later that dai to mari magdalen alon john 20 11 18 and to simon peter also alon luke 24 34 in the afternoon he walk with two of hi follow toward emmau luke 24 13 35 and that night he appear to ten of the apostl gather togeth in an upper room at jerusalem mark 16 14 16 luke 24 36 40 etc a week later he appear to all eleven of the apostl probabl at the same place john 20 26 28 onc he wa seen by abov 500 brethren on a mountain in galile i corinthian 15 6 and final to the apostl just befor hi ascens mark 16 19 luke 24 50 52 act 1 3 8 as with the fact of the empti tomb so in regard to these histor ical record appear all kind of theori have been propos attempt to deni their liter but these theori ar unreason without support evid none ha ever won the unanim approv of those who refus to believ in the realiti of the appear moreov while it is true we ar live in an ag when mai of our lead scientist and agnost and mani of our philosoph ar antisuperanaturalist let us not forget that some of the greatest thinker of the ag have firmli believ in thi great miracl increas mather presid of harvard timothi dwight presid of yale nathan lord presid of dartmouth edward hitchcock presid of amherst mark hopkin presid of william john witherspoon presid of princeton these men and countless other have believ it but suppos christ did rise from the dead what of it what ha it to do with my life what ha it to do with your life just thi it seal with certitud the teach of christ jesu taught mani great truth especi mani about himself he claim to have come down from god he said he wa the wai to god he said he wa the son of god who alon knew god perfectli he said that whoever believ on him had etern life and no on els had it he said that whatev we ask god in hi name he would grant it to us thu when he did rise from the grave on the third dai he reveal that in these amaz unparallel predict he spoke the truth do you know ani reason ani good reason why we should not believ that hi word ar all true the point is doe not the truth of the resurrect convinc us that he is none other than the on he claim to be the son of god and then of cours the fact that christ rose from the dead testifi that he ha broken the power of death and that he will some dai rais us also up from the grave as he promis in other word if thi person jesu christ the son of god in all thi he should be the cornerston of the foundat of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiv of sin hi compan ionship and help a joi that no circumst can ever take awai and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect dai those who have tri it down through the ag and there have been mani have given their testimoni and we todai who believ also know
