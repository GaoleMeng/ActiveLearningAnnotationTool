1 us commerci space sale flatten in 1993 the us depart of commerc project us commerci space sale will remain flat in 1993 with current data show onli a 2 percent growth over 1992 as publish in us industri outlook 1993 which wa releas in januari revenu from the 1993 us space busi ar current project to be about $4 890 m in contrast to previou year when us commerci space sale had shown doubl digit growth rate thi year s project result ar driven by the us satellit manufactur industri where sale ar project to drop from 12 satellit worth $1 300 m in 1992 to 7 satellit worth $ 670 m in 1993 the us industri outlook also project u s commerci launcher face flat demand in come year and while predict that 1993 revenu will increas 10 percent to $450 m futur sale will be advers affect by the downward revis in depart of defens launch plan offset flat launch revenu and satellit deliveri revenu for fix and mobil satellit servic ar project to increas to $1 900 m primarili driven by increas

for 1993 commentari thi is the first look at how the us commerci space industri is expect to do in 1993 in gener not a bad report with most of the bad new concentr in the satellit manufactur area there chang of onli a few satellit worth $100 m or so apiec can substanti influenc the annual project if we look forward over sever year thi market sector should retain strong sale as us firm have been veri success in regain intern market share in the satellit busi furthermor sale of satellit ground equip should go up in the next revis of thi data expect to be releas about mid year data on mobil satellit ground equip sale includ such item as gp receiv and portabl satellit termin appear to be miss from the januari data set doc usual publish a list of space busi indic in mid year and the next revis of commerci space revenu should be releas then i expect the revis revenu should easili top $5 000 m if the mobil satellit ground equip ar ad back into the number and the year should show about a 10% overal market growth look beyond thi year s data futur market look quit promis the doc project satellit servic revenu could top $3 000 m by 1995 if new mobil satellit servic and direct broadcast ar implement as plan and that mobil satellit station sale ar expect to continu to growth at 15 20 % per year through the mid 1990 s my number ar somewhat more pessimist for near term market growth but i agre the trend should be for substanti growth in us commerci space sale over at least the next 5 10 year my pessim is due to more conserv assumpt on market captur and growth in leo commun and satellit direct broadcast servic i don t believ all of the current player in the yet to be born leo commun satellit market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcast market will be financi success nor that sale growth will be as explos as current project it should also be note thi year s doc data is the first releas to show revenu from privat fund micrograv research facil the $60 m shown in the janurari data is primarili for the spacehab modul plan for launch in april on the space shuttl but also hidden in these number ar the project first sale from the comet orbit launch and

that it had select the delta to launch most of the satellit in the 66 satellit iridium leo commun constel and in mid april mcdonnel dougla wa award the usaf medium launch vehicl iii contract the launch servic contract with motorola for the iridium constel launch is for at launch of least 45 iridium satellit anoth 21 satellit have been contract to be launch by khrunichev enterpris in russian on 3 proton vehicl launch these 45 satellit plan for the delta will be launch 5 at a time provid for at least 9 launch addit satellit in the iridium constel such as a plan on orbit spare mai also be launch on delta although detail of the launch servic contract were report to be negoti and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc bid a variant of their delta ii launcher thi contract is onli initi worth $7 5 million but establish a set of launch option for up to 36 launch encompass launch from 1996 through 2002 these launch will deploi the next gener of the usaf s global posit system block iir navig satellit plu other program first option for to meet the usaf launch option is expect to be exercis thi year after which the usaf is expect to request launch of up to 6 delta per year for at least 6 year under thi contract the usaf can also request launch on demand servic from mdc for the 1996 2002 time period with a launch to occur within 40 dai of the request commentari if these two contract ar fulfil thei should provid an excel busi base for mdc s delta launch program through the turn of the centuri combin these two contract have a potenti for about 45 launch worth about $2 200 m to mdc and sustain a core busi base of $300 400 m year other contract for intern and commerci payload as well as for nasa medium elv class payload will add to thi busi base keep mdc as a viabl commer launch compani howev it should be note there ar risk element in these contract motorola s iridium leo commun constel ha not yet receiv a us feder commun commiss licens for oper in the u s nor ha motorola line up all the financ and financi partner for the iridium ventur without these approv or financi back there will be no iridium launch but hopefulli these uncertainti will be settl thi year similarli the usaf mlv iii program ha been the target of sever congression action which have slow the product of the gp block iir satellit and delet the fund for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nl spacelift program at thi time while it appear the mlv iii contract will be execut futur fund for the mlv iii and other usaf commerci launch contract is be reconsid as part of nation space launch strategi review some opinion express from within the administr and congress propos cancel of all elv upgrad program includ the mlv program in favor of the propos spacelift program such opinion mai have some weight in thi year s budget deliber particularli as dod fund will be more difficult to find in the shrink us defens budget 3 commerci remot sens ventur get doc go ahead the first

construct licens thi wa report to be at the request of worldview most industri specul identifi thi new ventur as a star war spinoff us sdi type technolog to provid digit earth sens data and heavili integr into digit gi databas for remot sens gi user most probabl custom for thi servic includ explor geologist agricultur planner and urban planner it is noteworthi thi is the first commerci ventur under the 1992 land remot sens polici act the act as pass last novemb provid that remot sens data gather from privat remot sens craft mai be sold to user at differ price prior to thi act remot sens data from all satellit had to be sold to all user at the same price and privat remot sens ventur would have had to sell at the govern set landsat data price there ar rumor of sever other potenti commerci remot sens ventur work their wai through the system at differ stage of develop i think the larg landsat and spot satellit system will provid the major of the satellit remot sens data market for the next decad or so in contrast to these larg govern sponsor remot sens system smaller market ventur such as worldview and other can exploit market nich and us innov technolog and i believ can find profit on the margin i predict there mai be some veri interest ventur appear in the next year or so 4 invest firm call gd s space biz still a good invest wall street invest hous morgan stanlei think gener dynam s space system divis could still be a moneymak despit have fail in the last 3 atla launch in a recent analyst s report morgan stanlei said we ar more than ever convinc that if the compani can return the atla to it histor 95% plu success rate thi will becom a highli profit cash gener unit base upon discuss with gd s corpor manag morgan stanlei project that if the atla problem ar clear up the unit could see $70 m in earn per year by 1995 and $100 m per year by 2000 thi is base upon gd s project of captur about 10 atla launch per year on the world market commentari three failur in a row of their launch system ha hurt gener dynam s space system divis sinc gd ha restructur to onli keep a veri few profit core busi mani market pundit have been specul gd s space busi might be next to be sold the morgan stanlei report indic gd s space system divis ha some potenti as a moneymak despit current problem if thei can get their act togeth sale ar project to be about $560 m in 1993 which will probabl gener a loss of about $25 m if gd can captur their project share of the space launch market and if thei have manag to clean up the reliabl of their atla launcher then thei could gener healthi profit from those sale but until thei demonstr the atla centaur program is back on track thi divis will continu to show substanti loss in respons to the sell off rumor in my opinion thi oper is not a realli good candid for takeov and quick profit to do such a takeov the current set corpor and division manag would be replac with anoth set from outsid the firm in gd ssd s case to get the divis back on track the manag team will have to concentr hard on the technic problem with the atla centaur as well as in sell atla servic thi would indic onli anoth firm with experi in rocket launch oper could find such talent in hous and be abl to convinc custom to bui their launch servic optim the firm would have substanti liquid rocket experi and experi in market space technolog internation as well candid for thi might be trw rockwel lockhe and martin and possibl mcdonnel dougla and boe but most of those firm have cash flow problem mdc have had a substanti busi contract boe and mdc ar involv with other launch firm lockhe or have taken on substanti debt martin and come up with the $700 1500 m purchas price for the divis is a big chunk of chang for ani compani 5 arian predict dip in launch demand arianespac the oper of the arian launch system is project a dip in launch demand in the late 1990 s in earli februari arianespac releas their annual market survei which detail their project of the space transport market for the next decad over short run arianespac expect to retain their domin posit and sustain a major share of the launch market of 54 intern and commerci launch plan through 1995 arian hold contract for 31 gener dynam atla vehicl hold 14 contract mcdonnel dougla delta hold 7 and great wall s long march vehicl hold 2 launch contract three quarter of futur launch contract for which arian can compet ar project to come from commun satellit with the remain 25% split between weather earth observ and scientif satellit most of the futur telecommun demand growth is predict to come from the asia pacif region arianespac expect the current market consolid of individu satellit oper into region or nation group will continu with these group invest in heavier satellit with larger commun payload carri more transpond arianespac predict the averag mass of telecommun satellit should increas by 20 % over todai s averag level to about 3000 kg in geo demand for commerci launch servic is expect to remain strong over the next three year but in the second half of the decad arianespac predict demand will decreas arianespac base thi predict upon a match of satellit transpond demand and suppli particularli as new data compress techniqu appear to could doubl or tripl transpond capac us exist or near term transpond on of the signific possibl chang in the market wa identifi as the arriv of new launch vehicl includ russian launch system but arianespac predict that in the long term investor purchas launch servic ar look for the best trade off between launch servic qualiti and price and that russian and other new launch servic will have to prove out their capabl and servic qualiti and their market penetr will be minim commentari arian releas their market survei annual and i report on their prior market survei in a past issu of csn sti compar the two survei there aren t outstand differ in the number the most notabl chang is the consider of new data compress techniqu reduc the demand for new physic transpond on orbit i note that in contrast to some predict demand for space base commun transpond appear to be remain strong while fiber optic line ar make substanti inroad into the establish point to point telecommun market grow demand for telecommun servic world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast servic have prevent a decreas in space transpond demand fiberopt cabl provid a higher capabl servic but onli from establish point a to establish point b to establish a fiberopt link it is necessari to instal cabl between the point and while there ar improv network solut instal a larg network of distribut fiberopt link can cost million or billion of dollar for broadcast servic where there is not an exist ground network structur satellit still offer the most cost effect solut and if new servic ar requir into a new region it is cheaper to instal a small satellit link cost onli a few ten of thousand of dollar and tie into the exist global satellit network thi allow rapid growth of new satellit servic and ha kept demand high the replac market for fiberopt is grow as well sinc as demand grow between the point servic it becom cost effect to later instal a fiberopt link to handl the increas in traffic sinc the telecommun and data transfer market ar still grow rapidli satellit market project remain rosi but satellit ar also get longer orbit lifetim current gener satellit ar now get guarante of at 15 year of on orbit servic or more in contrast to 10 year of servic from last gener s satellit thi ha cut back some of the launch demand as satellit owner ar reschedul replac satellit launch over longer interv and as last note arianespac didn t flag it thi year but it look like the space transport market will be rather over suppli by exist launch system in the near term the annual commerci launch demand is for about 15 20 medium size satellit per year from the suppli side arian is capabl of launch up to about a dozen medium size satellit a year delta is capabl of about 9 12 per year atla is capabl of 6 12 long march 4 8 japan s h vehicl 2 4 russia s proton capabl of 8 and other system such as zenit and soyuz anoth 10 20 medium launch per year that s a lot of capabl for a small market we can onli expect the competit to intensifi for commerci launch 6 ntsb investig pegasu launch over abort abort the 9 feb pegasu launch by orbit scienc corpor ha spawn an investig over an appar violat of rang safeti rule a valid abort order from a nasa rang safeti offic to halt the mission wa overridden and the pegasu wa launch in violat of rang safeti rule in the last few minut of the pegasu launch countdown on of two abort command receiv aboard the pegasu fail such a failur typic scrub a launch and a nasa rang safeti offic at wallop island va issu a mission abort order about a minut befor the schedul pegasu launch somehow thi command wa overridden by the osc launch team or the messag wa lost in the commun channel and the pegasu wa launch despit the valid abort call fortun the pegasu function as expect and the abort command receiv wa not need but thi incid did spark an investig sinc a valid abort order wa given under agre to launch constraint rule and wa not obei lead the investig is the nation transport safeti board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air forc thi investig mark the first time ntsb ha taken the lead on an incid involv a space launch accord to the ntsb their investig will take about 6 month and is primarili look at line of author commun link and safeti procedur us in the launch commentari thi is the first time that the ntsb ha led an investig into a space launch their leadership wa request by the depart of commerc s offic of commerci space transport who had licens the commerci launch at the time of write thi column some of the initi investig have been conclud and some of the result ar start to leak out into the trade press appar 3 or four differ commun channel were in us dure the test after the abort destruct receiv stop respond the nasa test director and rang control in the mission control room at wallop island gave abort order about a minut befor the launch accord to the mission rule thi should have stop the launch somehow the osc test conductor order the abort revers and the nasa commun on the net relai that order to the b 52 carri the pegasu at about 22 second befor launch differ explain of exactli how thi happen ar propos with the best set be that clear line of commun and clear definit of the respons of the mission control team and understand of the mission rule were not establish befor the launch as we see more and more commerci launch more of these procedur issu ar go to crop up and will have to be resolv thi case is interest becaus it is the first time the ntsb ha been call in to investig a commerci launch problem as thei do with commerci aircraft problem i think thi problem will turn out to be primarili problem with procedur and commun and will be clear up with issuanc of guidelin on how launch commun should be set up and how specif line of author should be delin 7 anoth pegasu competitor is announc tsniimach
