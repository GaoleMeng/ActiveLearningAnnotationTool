archiv name atheism logic alt atheism archiv name logic last modifi 5 april 1993 version 1 4 construct a logic argument although there is much argument on usenet the gener qualiti of argument found is poor thi articl attempt to provid a gentl introduct to logic in the hope of improv the gener level of debat logic is the scienc of reason proof think or infer concis o logic allow us to analyz a piec of reason and determin whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of cours on doe not need to studi logic in order to reason correctli nevertheless a littl basic knowledg of logic is often help when construct or analyz an argument note that no claim is be made here about whether logic is univers applic the matter is veri much open for debat thi document mere explain how to us logic given that you have alreadi decid that logic is the right tool for the job proposit or statement ar the build block of a logic argument a proposit is a statement which is either true or fals for exampl it is rain or todai is tuesdai proposit mai be either assert said to be true or deni said to be fals note that thi is a technic mean of deni not the everydai mean the proposit is the mean of the statement not the particular arrang of word us to express it so god exist and there exist a god both express the same proposit an argument is to quot the monti python sketch a connect seri of statement to establish a definit proposit an argument consist of three stage first of all the proposit which ar necessari for the argument to continu ar state these ar call the premis of the argument thei ar the evid or reason for accept the argument and it conclus premis or assert ar often indic by phrase such as becaus sinc obvious and so on the phrase obvious is often view with suspicion as it can be us to intimid other into accept suspici premis if someth doesn t seem obviou to you don t be afraid to question it you can alwai sai oh ye you re right it is obviou when you ve heard the explan next the premis ar us to deriv further proposit by a process known as infer in infer on proposit is arriv at on the basi of on or more other proposit alreadi accept there ar variou form of valid infer the proposit arriv at by infer mai then be us in further infer infer is often denot by phrase such as impli that or therefor final we arriv at the conclus of the argument the proposit which is affirm on the basi of the premis and infer conclus ar often indic by phrase such as therefor it follow that we conclud and so on the conclus is often state as the final stage of infer for exampl everi event ha a caus premis the univers ha a begin premis all begin involv an event premis thi impli that the begin of the univers involv an event infer therefor the univers ha a caus infer and conclus note that the conclus of on argument might be a premis in anoth argument a proposit can onli be call a premis or a conclus with respect to a particular argument the term do not make sens in isol sometim an argument will not follow the order given abov for exampl the conclus might be state first and the premis state afterward in support of the conclus thi is perfectli valid if sometim a littl confus recogn an argument is much harder than recogn premis or conclus mani peopl shower their write with assert without ever produc anyth which on might reason describ as an argument some statement look like argument but ar not for exampl if the bibl is accur jesu must either have been insan an evil liar or the son of god thi is not an argument it is a condit statement it doe not assert the premis which ar necessari to support what appear to be it conclus it also suffer from a number of other logic flaw but we ll come to those later anoth exampl god creat you therefor do your duti to god the phrase do your duti to god is not a proposit sinc it is neither true nor fals therefor it is not a conclus and the sentenc is not an argument final causal is import consid a statement of the form a becaus b if we re interest in establish a and b is offer as evid the statement is an argument if we re try to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explan for exampl there must be someth wrong with the engin of my car becaus it will not start thi is an argument my car will not start becaus there is someth wrong with the engin thi is an explan there ar two tradit type of argument deduct and induct a deduct argument is on which provid conclus proof of it conclus that is an argument where if the premis ar true the conclus must also be true a deduct argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defin as on where if the premis ar true then the conclus is true an induct argument is on where the premis provid some evid for the truth of the conclus induct argument ar not valid or invalid howev we can talk about whether thei ar better or wors than other argument and about how probabl their premis ar there ar form of argument in ordinari languag which ar neither deduct nor induct howev we will concentr for the moment on deduct argument as thei ar often view as the most rigor and convinc it is import to note that the fact that a deduct argument is valid doe not impli that it conclus hold thi is becaus of the slightli counter intuit natur of implic which we must now consid more carefulli obvious a valid argument can consist of true proposit howev an argument mai be entir valid even if it contain onli fals proposit for exampl all insect have wing premis woodlic ar insect premis therefor woodlic have wing conclus here the conclus is not true becaus the argument s premis ar fals if the argument s premis were true howev the conclus would be true the argument is thu entir valid more subtli we can reach a true conclus from on or more fals premis as in all fish live in the sea premis dolphin ar fish premis therefor dolphin live in the sea conclus howev the on thing we cannot do is reach a fals conclus through valid infer from true premis we can therefor draw up a truth tabl for implic the symbol denot implic a is the premis b the conclus t and f repres true and fals respect premis conclus infer a b a b f f t if the premis ar fals and the infer f t t valid the conclus can be true or fals t f f if the premis ar true and the conclus fals the infer must be invalid t t t if the premis ar true and the infer valid the conclus must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose premis ar true a sound argument therefor arriv at a true conclus be care not to confus valid argument with sound argument to delv further into the structur of logic argument would requir lengthi discuss of linguist and philosophi it is simpler and probabl more us to summar the major pitfal to be avoid when construct an argument these pitfal ar known as fallaci in everydai english the term fallaci is us to refer to mistaken belief as well as to the faulti reason that lead to those belief thi is fair enough but in logic the term is gener us to refer to a form of technic incorrect argument especi if the argument appear valid or convinc so for the purpos of thi discuss we defin a fallaci as a logic argument which appear to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examin more close by studi fallaci we aim to avoid be misl by them the follow list of fallaci is not intend to be exhaust argumentum ad baculum appeal to forc the appeal to forc is commit when the arguer resort to forc or the threat of forc in order to try and push the accept of a conclus it is often us by politician and can be summar as might make right the forc threaten need not be a direct threat from the arguer for exampl thu there is ampl proof of the truth of the bibl all those who refus to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is liter argument direct at the man the abus varieti of argumentum ad hominem occur when instead of try to disprov the truth of an assert the arguer attack the person or peopl make the assert thi is invalid becaus the truth of an assert doe not depend upon the good of those assert it for exampl atheism is an evil philosophi it is practis by communist and murder sometim in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimoni of a wit by show for exampl that he is a known perjur thi is a valid wai of reduc the credibl of the testimoni given by the wit and not argumentum ad hominem howev it doe not demonstr that the wit s testimoni is fals to conclud otherwis is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewher in thi list the circumstanti form of argumentum ad hominem is commit when a person argu that hi oppon ought to accept the truth of an assert becaus of the oppon s particular circumst for exampl it is perfectli accept to kill anim for food how can you argu otherwis when you re quit happi to wear leather shoe thi is an abus charg of inconsist us as an excus for dismiss the oppon s argument thi fallaci can also be us as a mean of reject a conclus for exampl of cours you would argu that posit discrimin is a bad thing you re white thi particular form of argumentum ad hominem when on alleg that on s adversari is ration a conclus form from selfish interest is also known as poison the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium mean argument from ignor thi fallaci occur whenev it is argu that someth must be true simpli becaus it ha not been prove fals or equival when it is argu that someth must be fals becaus it ha not been prove true note that thi is not the same as assum that someth is fals until it ha been prove true a basic scientif principl exampl of cours the bibl is true nobodi can prove otherwis of cours telepathi and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobodi ha shown ani proof that thei ar real note that thi fallaci doe not appli in a court of law where on is gener assum innoc until proven guilti also in scientif investig if it is known that an event would produc certain evid of it have occur the absenc of such evid can validli be us to infer that the event did not occur for exampl a flood as describ in the bibl would requir an enorm volum of water to be present on the earth the earth doe not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ic at the pole therefor no such flood occur in scienc we can validli assum from lack of evid that someth ha not occur we cannot conclud with certainti that it ha not occur howev argumentum ad misericordiam thi is the appeal to piti also known as special plead the fallaci is commit when the arguer appeal to piti for the sake of get a conclus accept for exampl i did not murder my mother and father with an ax pleas don t find me guilti i m suffer enough through be an orphan argumentum ad populum thi is known as appeal to the galleri or appeal to the peopl to commit thi fallaci is to attempt to win accept of an assert by appeal to a larg group of peopl thi form of fallaci is often character by emot languag for exampl pornographi must be ban it is violenc against women the bibl must be true million of peopl know that it is ar you try to tell them that thei ar all mistaken fool argumentum ad numeram thi fallaci is close relat to the argumentum ad populum it consist of assert that the more peopl who support or believ a proposit the more like it is that that proposit is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to author us the admir of the famou to try and win support for an assert for exampl isaac newton wa a geniu and he believ in god thi line of argument is not alwai complet bogu for exampl refer to an admit author in a particular field mai be relev to a discuss of that subject for exampl we can distinguish quit clearli between stephen hawk ha conclud that black hole give off radiat and john searl ha conclud that it is imposs to build an intellig comput hawk is a physicist and so we can reason expect hi opinion on black hole radiat to be inform searl is a linguist so it is question whether he is well qualifi to speak on the subject of machin intellig the fallaci of accid the fallaci of accid is commit when a gener rule is appli to a particular case whose accident circumst mean that the rule is inapplic it is the error made when on goe from the gener to the specif for exampl christian gener dislik atheist you ar a christian so you must dislik atheist thi fallaci is often commit by moralist and legalist who try to decid everi moral and legal question by mechan appli gener rule convers accid hasti gener thi fallaci is the revers of the fallaci of accid it occur when on form a gener rule by examin onli a few specif case which ar not repres of all possibl case for exampl jim bakker wa an insincer christian therefor all christian ar insincer sweep gener dicto simplicit a sweep gener occur when a gener rule is appli to a particular situat in which the featur of that particular situat render the rule inapplic a sweep gener is the opposit of a hasti gener non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these ar known as fals caus fallaci the fallaci of non causa pro causa occur when on identifi someth as the caus of an event but it ha not actual been shown to be the caus for exampl i took an aspirin and prai to god and my headach disappear so god cure me of the headach the fallaci of post hoc ergo propter hoc occur when someth is assum to be the caus of an event mere becaus it happen befor the event for exampl the soviet union collaps after take up atheism therefor we must avoid atheism for the same reason cum hoc ergo propter hoc thi fallaci is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it assert that becaus two event occur togeth thei must be causal relat and leav no room for other factor that mai be the caus s of the event petitio principii thi fallaci occur when the premis ar at least as question as the conclus reach circulu in demonstrando thi fallaci occur when on assum as a premis the conclus which on wish to reach often the proposit will be rephras so that the fallaci appear to be a valid argument for exampl homosexu must not be allow to hold govern offic henc ani govern offici who is reveal to be a homosexu will lose hi job therefor homosexu will do anyth to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefor homosexu cannot be allow to hold govern offic note that the argument is entir circular the premis is the same as the conclus an argument like the abov ha actual been cite as the reason for the british secret servic offici ban on homosexu employe anoth exampl is the classic we know that god exist becaus the bibl tell us so and we know that the bibl is true becaus it is the word of god complex question fallaci of interrog thi is the fallaci of presupposit on exampl is the classic load question have you stop beat your wife the question presuppos a definit answer to anoth question which ha not even been ask thi trick is often us by lawyer in cross examin when thei ask question like where did you hide the monei you stole similarli politician often ask load question such as how long will thi ec interfer in our affair be allow to continu or doe the chancellor plan two more year of ruinou privat ignoratio elenchi the fallaci of irrelev conclus consist of claim that an argument support a particular conclus when it is actual logic noth to do with that conclus for exampl a christian mai begin by sai that he will argu that the teach of christian ar undoubt true if he then argu at length that christian is of great help to mani peopl no matter how well he argu he will not have shown that christian teach ar true sadli such fallaci argument ar often success becaus thei arous emot which caus other to view the suppos conclus in a more favour light equivoc equivoc occur when a kei word is us with two or more differ mean in the same argument for exampl what could be more afford than free softwar but to make sure that it remain free that user can do what thei like with it we must place a licens on it to make sure that will alwai be freeli redistribut amphiboli amphiboli occur when the premis us in an argument ar ambigu becaus of careless or ungrammat phrase accent accent is anoth form of fallaci through shift mean in thi case the mean is chang by alter which part of a statement ar emphas for exampl consid we should not speak ill of our friend and we should not speak ill of our friend fallaci of composit on fallaci of composit is to conclud that a properti share by the part of someth must appli to the whole for exampl the bicycl is made entir of low mass compon and is therefor veri lightweight the other fallaci of composit is to conclud that a properti of a number of individu item is share by a collect of those item for exampl a car us less petrol and caus less pollut than a bu therefor car ar less environment damag than buse fallaci of divis the fallaci of divis is the opposit of the fallaci of composit like it opposit it exist in two varieti the first is to assum that a properti of some thing must appli to it part for exampl you ar studi at a rich colleg therefor you must be rich the other is to assum that a properti of a collect of item is share by each item for exampl ant can destroi a tree therefor thi ant can destroi a tree the slipperi slope argument thi argument state that should on event occur so will other harm event there is no proof made that the harm event ar caus by the first event for exampl if we legal marijuana then we would have to legal crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addict on welfar therefor we cannot legal marijuana a is base on b fallaci is a type of fallaci these fallaci occur when on attempt to argu that thing ar in some wai similar without actual specifi in what wai thei ar similar exampl isn t histori base upon faith if so then isn t the bibl also a form of histori islam is base on faith christian is base on faith so isn t islam a form of christian cat ar a form of anim base on carbon chemistri dog ar a form of anim base on carbon chemistri so aren t dog a form of cat affirm of the consequ thi fallaci is an argument of the form a impli b b is true therefor a is true to understand why it is a fallaci examin the truth tabl for implic given earlier denial of the anteced thi fallaci is an argument of the form a impli b a is fals therefor b is fals again the truth tabl for implic make it clear why thi is a fallaci note that thi fallaci is differ from non causa pro causa the latter ha the form a impli b a is fals therefor b is fals where a doe not in fact impli b at all here the problem is not that the implic is invalid rather it is that the fals of a doe not allow us to deduc anyth about b convert a condit thi fallaci is an argument of the form if a then b therefor if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam thi is the fallaci of assert that someth is right or good simpli becaus it is old or becaus that s the wai it s alwai been argumentum ad novitam thi is the opposit of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallaci of assert that someth is more correct simpli becaus it is new or newer than someth els argumentum ad crumenam the fallaci of believ that monei is a criterion of correct that those with more monei ar more like to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallaci of assum that becaus someon is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuou than on who is wealthier thi fallaci is the opposit of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam thi is the incorrect belief that an assert is more like to be true the more often it is heard an argumentum ad nauseum is on that emploi constant repetit in assert someth bifurc also refer to as the black and white fallaci bifurc occur when on present a situat as have onli two altern where in fact other altern exist or can exist plurium interrogationum mani question thi fallaci occur when a question demand a simpl answer to a complex question non sequitur a non sequitur is an argument where the conclus is drawn from premis which ar not logic connect with it red her thi fallaci is commit when irrelev materi is introduc to the issu be discuss so that everyon s attent is divert awai from the point be made toward a differ conclus reific hypostat reific occur when an abstract concept is treat as a concret thing shift the burden of proof the burden of proof is alwai on the person make an assert or proposit shift the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallaci of put the burden of proof on the person who deni or question the assert be made the sourc of the fallaci is the assumpt that someth is true unless proven otherwis straw man the straw man fallaci is to misrepres someon els s posit so that it can be attack more easili then to knock down that misrepres posit then to conclud that the origin posit ha been demolish it is a fallaci becaus it fail to deal with the actual argument that have been made the extend analog the fallaci of the extend analog often occur when some suggest gener rule is be argu over the fallaci is to assum that mention two differ situat in an argument about a gener rule constitut a claim that those situat ar analog to each other thi fallaci is best explain us a real exampl from a debat about anti cryptographi legisl i believ it is alwai wrong to oppos the law by break it such a posit is odiou it impli that you would not have support martin luther king ar you sai that cryptographi legisl is as import as the struggl for black liber how dare you tu quoqu thi is the famou you too fallaci it occur when an action is argu to be accept becaus the other parti ha perform it for instanc you re just be randomli abus so you ve been abus too
