in articl lsu7q7innia5 saltillo cs utexa edu turpin cs utexa edu russel turpin write i agre with everyth that lee ladi wrote in her previou post in thi thread gee mayb i ve misjudg you russel anyon who agre with someth i sai can t be all bad serious i m not sure whether i misjudg you or not in on respect i still have a major problem though with your insist that scienc is mainli about avoid mistak and i still disagre with your content that nobodi who doesn t us method deem scientif can possibl know what s true and what s not delet materi which i agre with back to lee ladi these ar not the rule accord to mani who post to sci med and sci psycholog accord to these poster if it s not support by carefulli design control studi then it s not scienc these poster ar make the mistak that i have previous critic of adher to a methodolog recip a carefulli rule such as support the hypothesi by a carefulli design and control studi ar too narrow to appli to all investig i think that the requir for particular reason to be convinc depend greatli on the kind of mistak that have occur in past reason about the same kind of thing to reus the previou exampl we know that conclus from uncontrol observ of the treatment of chronic medic problem ar notori problemat okai so let s see if we agre on thi first of all there ar degre of certainti it might be appropri for instanc to demand carefulli control trial befor we accept as absolut scientif truth to the extent that there is ani such thing the effect of a certain treatment on the other hand highli favor clinic experi even if uncontrol can be adequ to justifi a preliminari judgement that a treatment is us thi is often the best evid we can hope for from investig who do not have institut or corpor support in thi case it make sens to tent treat claim as credibl but to reserv final judgement until establish scientist who ar qualifi and have the necessari resourc can do more care test secondli it make sens to be more toler in our standard of evid for a pronounc effect than for on that is margin i come to thi disput about what scienc is not onli as a mathematician but as a veteran of mani argument in sci psycholog and occasion in sci med about nlp neurolinguist program much of the work done to date by nlper can be better categor as inform explor than as care scientif research for year now i have been try to get scientif and clinic psychologist to just take a look at it to read a few of the book and watch some of the videotap courtesi of your local univers librari not for the purpos of make a definit judgement but simpli to look at the nlp methodolog especi the approach to elicit inform from subject and look for idea and hypothes which might be of scientif interest and most especi to be awar of the question nlp suggest which might be worthi of scientif investig over and over again the respons i get in sci pycholog is if thi hasn t been thoroughli valid by the accept form of empir research then it can t be of ani interest to us to me the ultim reducio ad absurdum of the extrem there ve got to be control studi posit is an nlp techniqu call the fast phobia trauma cure simpl phobia as oppos to agoraphobia mai not be the world s most import psycholog disord but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophist instrument to diagnos them or tell when someon is cure of on the nlp phobia cure is a simpl visual which requir less than 15 minut nlper claim that it can also be us to neutral a traumat memori and henc is us in treat post traumat stress syndrom it is essenti a variat on the classic desensit process us by behavior therapist a subject onli need to be taken through the techniqu onc or in the case of ptsd onc for each traumat incid the process doesn t need to be repeat and the subject doesn t need to practic it over again at home now to me it seem pretti easi to test the effect of thi cure especi if as nlper claim the success rate is extrem high take someon with a fear of height as i us to have take them up to a balconi on the 20th floor and observ their respons spend 15 minut to have them do the simpl visual send them back up to the balconi and see if thing have chang check back with them in a few week to see if the cure seem to be last more long term follow up is certainli desir but from a scientif point of view even a cure that last sever week ha signific in ani case there ar mani known case where the cure ha last year to the best of my knowledg there is no known case where the cure ha been revers after hold for a few week my own cure incident wa done with a slightli differ nlp techniqu befor i learn of the fast phobia trauma cure ten year later now i enjoi live on the 17th floor of my build and have a larg balconi the folk over in sci psycholog have a hundr and on excus not to make thi simpl test thei claim that onli an elabor outcom studi will be satisfactori a studi of the sort that nlp practition mani of whom make a bare margin live from their practic can ill afford to do most of them ar also just plain not interest becaus the whole idea seem frivol and sinc thei re not part of the scientif establish thei have no tangibl reward to gain from scientif accept the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten year old now and the clinic psycholog establish is still sai we don t have ani wai of know that it s effect these academ themselv have the resourc to do a studi as elabor as anyon could want of cours but thei sai why should i prove your theori and the burden of proof is on the on make the claim on academ in sci psycholog said that it would be complet unscientif for him to test the phobia cure sinc it hasn t been describ in a scientif journal it s describ in a number of book and i ve post articl in sci psycholog describ it in as much detail as i m capabl of actual at least on fairli care academ studi ha been done with favor result but it s appar not accept becaus it s a doctor dissert and not publish in a refere journal to me thi sort of attitud doe not advanc scienc but hinder it thi is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnair attitud about scienc now mayb i have been unfair in imput such attitud to you russel if so i apolog in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivist psycholog seem less like a scienc than a collect of compet religi sect ladi uhunix
