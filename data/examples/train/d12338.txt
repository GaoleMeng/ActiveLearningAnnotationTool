thank for the respos as thei were all good idea and i am look at us a coupl of the idea i reciev in the mail todai the spec sheet on the mil spec version of exar s xr 2240 timer counter chip it is stabl down to 50 c and suck veri littl power thei show an applic for a ultra long time delai up to sever year depend on the rc time constant in thi applic thei have two of them cascad togeth the reset and trigger pin of both chip ar ti togeth and the timebas of the second chip is disabl in thi configur the output is high when the system is reset when trigger the output goe low and stai that wai for a total of 65 536 x the time cycl of the first chip the total time cycl of the two chip can be program from to 256 x r x c to 65 536 x r x c in 256 step by select ani combin of the counter output to the timer output the beauti of it is the timebas chip would onli have to have a 100uf time cap and a 391k resistor for 39 1 second per time cycl so i can get a maximum of 2 562 457 6 second between time cycl 39 1 x 65 536 or about 29 dai of cours that s much more than i need 14 dai but the counter allow for 256 binari step that can be select for the output for the pellet puker after the first 14 dai and it trip it would reset it self for the next 14 dai time cycl and so forth power is still a problem though a few idea that you suggest wa to buri the electron in a hole dug in the snow as an insul and put the pellet puker up on a tower abov the estim snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charg on a lithium batteri pack i like that idea thi thing ha to work for at least six week for three sampl and the ga valv ar 12 volt to spit the pellet out onto the snow anywai i order the xr 2240 s to see what i can do with them should be interest as long as i m not the on that ha to go dig up the pellet in the middl of antartica freez my bun off thank again everyon we
