first close up imag voyag 1 follow in novemb 1980 send back breathtak photograph that reveal for the first time the complex of saturn s ring system and moon voyag 2 flew by the planet and it moon in august 1981 the ring ar compos of countless low densiti particl orbit individu around saturn s equat at progress distanc from the cloud top analysi of spacecraft radio wave pass through the ring show that the particl vari wide in size rang from dust to hous size boulder the ring ar bright becaus thei ar mostli ic and frost rock the ring might have result when a moon or a pass bodi ventur too close to saturn the unlucki object would have been torn apart by great tidal forc on it surfac and in it interior or the object mai not have been fulli form to begin with and disintegr under the influenc of saturn s graviti a third possibl is that the object wa shatter by collis with larger object orbit the planet unabl either to form into a moon or to drift awai from each other individu ring particl appear to be held in place by the gravit pull of saturn and it satellit these complex gravit interact form the thousand of ringlet that make up the major ring radio emiss quit similar to the static heard on an am car radio dure an electr storm were detect by the voyag spacecraft these emiss ar typic of lightn but ar believ to be come from saturn s ring system rather than it atmospher where no lightn wa observ as thei had at jupit the voyag saw a version of earth s aurora near saturn s pole the voyag discov new moon and found sever satellit that share the same orbit we learn that some moon shepherd ring particl maintain saturn s ring and the gap in the ring saturn s 18th moon wa discov in 1990 from imag taken by voyag 2 in 1981 voyag 1 determin that titan ha a nitrogen base atmospher with methan and argon on more like earth s in composit than the carbon dioxid atmospher of mar and venu titan s surfac temperatur of 179 degre celsiu 290 degre fahrenheit impli that there might be water ic island rise abov ocean of ethan methan liquid or sludg unfortun voyag s camera could not penetr the moon s dens cloud continu photochemistri from solar radiat mai be convert titan s methan to ethan acetylen and in combin with nitrogen hydrogen cyanid the latter compound is a build block of amino acid these condit mai be similar to the atmospher condit of primev earth between three and four billion year ago howev titan s atmospher temperatur is believ to be too low to permit progress beyond thi stage of organ chemistri the explor of saturn will continu with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploi a probe call huygen which will be drop into titan s atmospher and fall to the surfac cassini will us the probe as well as radar to peer through titan s cloud and will spend year examin the saturnian system uranu in januari 1986 four and a half year after visit saturn voyag 2 complet the first close up survei of the uranian system the brief flybi reveal more inform about uranu and it retinu of ici moon than had been glean from ground observ sinc the planet s discoveri over two centuri ago by the english astronom william herschel uranu third largest of the planet is an oddbal of the solar system unlik the other planet with the except of pluto thi giant li tip on it side with it north and south pole altern face the sun dure an 84 year swing around the solar system dure voyag 2 s flybi the south pole face the sun uranu might have been knock over when an earth size object collid with it earli in the life of the solar system voyag 2 found that uranu magnet field doe not follow the usual north south axi found on the other planet instead the field is tilt 60 degre and offset from the planet s center a phenomenon that on earth would be like have on magnet pole in new york citi and the other in the citi of djakarta on the island of java in indonesia uranu atmospher consist mainli of hydrogen with some 12 percent helium and small amount of ammonia methan and water vapor the planet s blue color occur becaus methan in it atmospher absorb all other color wind speed rang up to 580 kilomet 360 mile per hour and temperatur near the cloud top averag 221 degre celsiu 366 degre fahrenheit uranu sunlit south pole is shroud in a kind of photochem smog believ to be a combin of acetylen ethan and other sunlight gener chemic surround the planet s atmospher and extend thousand of kilomet into space is a mysteri ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow approxim 8 000 kilomet 5 000 mile below uranu cloud top there is thought to be a scald ocean of water and dissolv ammonia some 10 000 kilomet 6 200 mile deep beneath thi ocean is an earth size core of heavier materi voyag 2 discov 10 new moon 16 169 kilomet 10 105 mile in diamet orbit uranu the five previous known miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon rang in size from 520 to 1 610 kilomet 323 to 1 000 mile across repres a geolog showcas these five moon ar half ic half rock sphere that ar cold and dark and show evid of past activ includ fault and ic flow the most remark of uranu moon is miranda it surfac featur high cliff as well as canyon crater pock plain and wind vallei the sharp variat in terrain suggest that after the moon form it wa smash apart by a collis with anoth bodi an event not unusu in our solar system which contain mani object that have impact crater or ar fragment from larg impact what is extraordinari is that miranda appar reform with some of the materi that had been in it interior expos on it surfac uranu wa thought to have nine dark ring voyag 2 imag 11 in contrast to saturn s ring which ar compos of bright particl uranu ring ar primarili made up of dark boulder size chunk neptun voyag 2 complet it 12 year tour of the solar system with an investig of neptun and the planet s moon on august 25 1989 the spacecraft swept to within 4 850 kilomet 3 010 mile of neptun and then flew on to the moon triton dure the neptun encount it becam clear that the planet s atmospher wa more activ than uranu voyag 2 observ the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptun s atmospher resembl jupit s great red spot the storm spin counterclockwis and move westward at almost 1 200 kilomet 745 mile per hour voyag 2 also note a smaller dark spot and a fast move cloud dub the scooter as well as high altitud cloud over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the highest wind speed of ani planet were observ up to 2 400 kilomet 1 500 mile per hour like the other giant planet neptun ha a gaseou hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet s core contain a higher percentag of rock and metal than those of the other ga giant neptun s distinct blue appear like uranu blue color is due to atmospher methan neptun s magnet field is tilt rel to the planet s spin axi and is not center at the core thi phenomenon is similar to uranu magnet field and suggest that the field of the two giant ar be gener in an area abov the core where the pressur is so great that liquid hydrogen assum the electr properti of a metal earth s magnet field on the other hand is produc by it spin metal core and is onli slightli tilt and offset rel to it center voyag 2 also shed light on the mysteri of neptun s ring observ from earth indic that there were arc of materi in orbit around the giant planet it wa not clear how neptun could have arc and how these could be kept from spread out into even unclump ring voyag 2 detect these arc but thei were in fact part of thin complet ring a number of small moon could explain the arc but such bodi were not spot astronom had identifi the neptunian moon triton in 1846 and nereid in 1949 voyag 2 found six more on of the new moon proteu is actual larger than nereid but sinc proteu orbit close to neptun it wa lost in the planet s glare for observ on earth triton circl neptun in a retrograd orbit in under six dai tidal forc on triton ar caus it to spiral slowli toward the planet in 10 to 100 million year a short time in astronom term the moon will be so close that neptunian graviti will tear it apart form a spectacular ring to accompani the planet s modest current ring triton s landscap is as strang and unexpect as those of io and miranda the moon ha more rock than it counterpart at saturn and uranu triton s mantl is probabl compos of water ic but the moon s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methan the moon show two dramat differ type of terrain the so call cantaloup terrain and a reced ic cap dark streak appear on the ic cap these streak ar the fallout from geyser like volcan vent that shoot nitrogen ga and dark fine grain particl to height of 2 to 8 kilomet 1 to 5 mile triton s thin atmospher onli 1 70 000th as thick as earth s ha wind that carri the dark particl and deposit them as streak on the ic cap the coldest surfac yet found in the solar system 235 degre celsiu 391 degre fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than ani other object spacecraft have so far visit pluto pluto is the most distant of the planet yet the eccentr of it orbit period carri it insid neptun s orbit where it ha been sinc 1979 and where it will remain until march 1999 pluto s orbit is also highli inclin tilt 17 degre to the orbit plane of the other planet discov in 1930 pluto appear to be littl more than a celesti snowbal the planet s diamet is calcul to be approxim 2 300 kilomet 1 430 mile onli two third the size of our moon ground base observ indic that pluto s surfac is cover with methan ic and that there is a thin atmospher that mai freez and fall to the surfac as the planet move awai from the sun observ also show that pluto s spin axi is tip by 122 degre the planet ha on known satellit charon discov in 1978 charon s surfac composit is differ from pluto s the moon appear to be cover with water ic rather than methan ic it orbit is gravitation lock with pluto so both bodi alwai keep the same hemispher face each other pluto s and charon s rotat period and charon s period of revolut ar all 6 4 earth dai although no spacecraft have ever visit pluto nasa is current explor the possibl of such a mission comet the outermost member of the solar system occasion pai a visit to the inner planet as asteroid ar the rocki and metal remnant of the format of the solar system comet ar the ici debri from that dim begin and can surviv onli far from the sun most comet nuclei resid in the oort cloud a loos swarm of object in a halo beyond the planet and reach perhap halfwai to the nearest star comet nuclei orbit in thi frozen abyss until thei ar gravitation perturb into new orbit that carri them close to the sun as a nucleu fall insid the orbit of the outer planet the volatil element of which it is made gradual warm by the time the nucleu enter the region of the inner planet these volatil element ar boil the nucleu itself is irregular and onli a few mile across and is made princip of water ic with methan and ammonia materi veri similar to those compos the moon of the giant planet as these materi boil off of the nucleu thei form a coma or cloud like head that can measur ten of thousand of kilomet across the coma grow as the comet get closer to the sun the stream of charg particl come from the sun push on thi cloud blow it back like a flag in the wind and give rise to the comet s tail gase and ion ar blown directli back from the nucleu but dust particl ar push more slowli as the nucleu continu in it orbit the dust particl ar left behind in a curv arc both the ga and dust tail point awai from the sun in effect the comet chase it tail as it reced from the sun the tail can reach 150 million kilomet 93 million mile in length but the total amount of materi contain in thi dramat displai would fit in an ordinari suitcas comet from the latin cometa mean long hair ar essenti dramat light show some comet pass through the solar system onli onc but other have their orbit gravitation modifi by a close encount with on of the giant outer planet these latter visitor can enter close ellipt orbit and repeatedli return to the inner solar system hallei s comet is the most famou exampl of a rel short period comet return on an averag of onc everi 76 year and orbit from beyond neptun to within venu orbit confirm sight of the comet go back to 240 b c thi regular visitor to our solar system is name for sir edmond hallei becaus he plot the comet s orbit and predict it return base on earlier sight and newtonian law of motion hi name becam part of astronom lore when in 1759 the comet return on schedul unfortun sir edmond did not live to see it a comet can be veri promin in the sky if it pass compar close to earth unfortun on it most recent appear hallei s comet pass no closer than 62 4 million kilomet 38 8 million mile from our world the comet wa visibl to the nake ey especi for viewer in the southern hemispher but it wa not spectacular comet have been so bright on rare occas that thei were visibl dure daytim histor comet sight have been interpret as bad omen and have been artist render as dagger in the sky the comet rendezv asteroid flybi craf spacecraft will becom the first travel to fly close to a comet nucleu and remain in proxim to it as thei both approach the sun craf will observ the nucleu as it becom activ in the grow sunlight and begin to have it lighter element boil off and form a coma and tail sever spacecraft have flown by comet at high speed the first wa nasa s intern cometari explor in 1985 an armada of five spacecraft two japanes two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agenc flew by hallei s comet in 1986 conclus despit their effort to peer across the vast distanc of space through an obscur atmospher scientist of the past had onli on bodi thei could studi close earth but sinc 1959 spaceflight through the solar system ha lift the veil on our neighbor in space we have learn more about our solar system and it member than anyon had in the previou thousand of year our autom spacecraft have travel to the moon and to all the planet beyond our world except pluto thei have observ moon as larg as small planet flown by comet and sampl the solar environ astronomi book now includ detail pictur of bodi that were onli smudg in the largest telescop for gener we ar lucki to be aliv now to see these strang and beauti place and object the knowledg gain from our journei through the solar system ha redefin tradit earth scienc like geologi and meteorolog and spawn an entir new disciplin call compar planetolog by studi the geologi of planet moon asteroid and comet and compar differ and similar we ar learn more about the origin and histori of these bodi and the solar system as a whole we ar also gain insight into earth s complex weather system by see how weather is shape on other world and by investig the sun s activ and it influenc throughout the solar system we can better understand climat condit and process on earth we will continu to learn and benefit as our autom spacecraft explor our neighborhood in space on current mission is map venu other ar fly between world and will reach the sun and jupit after complex trajectori adjust futur mission ar plan for mar saturn a comet and the asteroid belt we can also look forward to the time when human will onc again set foot on an alien world although astronaut have not been back to the moon sinc decemb 1972 plan ar be formul for our return to the lunar landscap and for the human explor of mar and even the establish of martian outpost on dai take a holidai mai mean spend a week at a lunar base or a martian coloni end
