review of 1989 ford tauru sho by gene kim background last week i bought a 1989 ford tauru sho move up from drive a 1987 toyota celica st and a 1975 oldsmobil cutlass i have been interest in bui a sho for about five month and have been comb the classifi in denver and chicago everi week i bought a remark clean maroon red sho with 92k mile on it for $6800 as far as i can tell thi is about $2000 under blue book and i still have anoth 8000 mile befor the extend servic plan run out as on should with ani pre 1991 sho i made sure that the car wa alreadi refit with the upgrad clutch and pressur plate as well as have been recal for upgrad rotor and seatbelt attach howev my sho doe not have the newer rod shifter i understand i can get thi for $230 from ani ford servic center in addit the car receiv the full tune up at 60k mile receiv new platinum plug and valv adjust for a car with 92k mile on it the car wa virtual immacul the clearcoat paint job wa devoid of ani larg chip or dent although the front air dam mold wa cover with lot of small scratch not surpris sinc most of the mile were spent on the highwai have driven a smaller two door coup for so long i wa a bit concern about whether i could get us to drive a larger car to my surpris the size of the car doesn t bother me at all it seem just as nimbl as my celica no comparison with my oldsmobil visibl from the driver s seat is excel help mostli by of the small the quarter window aft of the back seat door window and in front of the c pillar and rear window parallel park is a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size in fact i m start to appreci the larg trunk as i pack up for a 14 hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on the ride later in thi review engin as with anyon even slightli interest in sho i wa veri interest in the 24 valv 3 0l yamaha shogun engin i wa not disappoint base perform of the engin under 4000 rpm is good you can even do reason launch from second gear although i don t make a practic of thi the engin rev smoothli and eagerli tool around town doe not requir mani shift thi is good sinc the shifter is definit on of the weakest point of the car more on thi later while the perform of the engin under 4000 rpm mai be unremark it undergo a jekyl hyde transform onc you hit higher rev at 4500 rpm a butterfli valv open and you can liter hear and feel the geometri of the engin chang as twelv more valv open up the engin soar to it 7000 rpm redlin and you ar treat to in my opinion the sweetest sound v6 around the engin inexplic sound overjoi to be at 6500 rpm i ve notic that when i drive around town i constantli watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm i am to go from 2000 rpm to 4000 you mai have to punch the acceler while torqu is more than adequ it doesn t come fulli onlin until those other 12 valv ar us transmiss when _car and driver_ first review the car in 1988 thei marvel at how ford had put such a wimpi clutch and balki shifter into the car i rememb drive a friend s parent s sho in 1990 and rememb think about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic the clutch wa that stiff that wa back then the entir clutch assembl on my sho ha been replac under a ford recal in 1991 the clutch on the sho feel no stiffer than the on on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seem a bit larger and more forgiv when plai with the shifter with the car park the shifter felt veri reason the 1 2 and 3 4 gate were where you d expect it to be and the shift action wa smooth on the road it s much the same but you have to shift slowli make no mistak it s a clumsi shifter when hurri shift like when i wa initi try to impress friend i consist miss the 1 2 shift often grope clumsili for the 2 3 shift and sometim even muff the 3 4 shift i find thi pretti amaz in a car like thi it also took me sever dai to realiz that you get the smoothest shift when you take your time seem obviou but compar to my toyota and my friend s honda thi seem atroci and clumsi someon on rec auto note that crx should blow sho off the line becaus of the incred clumsi shifter i now shift much more sedat and the shifter seem more reason when you plai within these bound the shifter work smoothli with no surpris i don t know whether the rod shifter upgrad would help at all along these same line i initi had troubl shift gear smoothli again slow down the shift and take more care to match rev when let out the clutch help immens thi took sever dai for me to get the hang of i think some of my problem were becaus i ve never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shift in higher gear occasion i have troubl shift into revers the shifter refus to enter the gate and i often grind the synchro try to get it into gear i ll be watch thi carefulli in the next coupl of month a quirk when i upshift and the engin drop back to 1000 2500 rpm i hear a whir and then a grind nois come from the the engin compart not terribl loud but the passeng can definit hear it i ask about it when i wa look at the car as do all my passeng appar thi is a definit a sho sound and is the gearbox appar call gear rollov repli to my queri on rec auto ar at the end of thi review exterior as i mention befor i am astound by how well the bodi of thi sho ha stood up paint chip on the front bumper and grill ar virtual non exist look at how older tauri sometim don t ag so gracefulli i wonder what the gui at ford did differ to the sho bodi the bodi in my opinion is extrem attract with match color bodi mold than the stock tauri for some odd reason the sho seem differ enough from vanilla tauri to get stare at stoplight of cours thi could be my overact imagin sho get fog light a more open grill a complet monochromat exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with sho stencil in relief i ve seen a coupl sho whose owner have color these in with floresc color or in black yuck i don t think the car is flashi i like it that wai i feel almost anonym with all those tauri out there but differ and distinct enough to those of us who care interior the interior is what realli make me feel like i don t deserv the car the seat ar grei leather the steer wheel and shifter ar cover with black leather and the entir instrument panel is done in a black grei metal scheme the instrument is stock tauru except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach you get a center consol with two cuphold a larg compart under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contain yet anoth compart three appropri size coin holder for tollwai i think and a compart for hold cassett tape there s map holder in the door and an oddli small glove compart i spill a whole can of coke in the cuphold and wa delight to find that the entir rubber holder can be remov and wash in a sink hei i m realli impress with the ergonom and thought that went into it design and it s a 1989 befor the interior wa upgrad the backseat is bigger than ani car i ve had why do thei need so much space no smart ass comment pleas the driver and passeng seat have lumbar and side bolster from what i hear it s not uncommon for the side bolster to show wear mine is no except the left side bolster on the driver s ha crack and i m not convinc the right bolster is inflat all the wai a big surpris for me i forgot that sho don t have a normal hand park brake instead thei have the regular park brake that you press with your left foot too bad again i m get us to it but it seem a bit anachronist to me ride the suspens is nice and stiff too stiff it s stiffer than ani car i ve had a friend s new 1993 toyota celica st seem tauter and is still abl to soak up bump better the sho seem stiffer with less abil to soak up bump drive over railroad track is a noisi and jar affair on the other hand take turn feel wonder becaus the bodi is so rigid and doesn t flex at all i listen for that befor i bought the car on the highwai the ride is great when i drove the car from chicago back to purdu i had troubl keep under 85 mph let alon from try to see what 100 mph realli feel like it s a rel quiet ride but the sunroof rattl i ve tri to find out what exactli make all the nois up there but it seem to be the window that rest on the rail no easi wai to get rid of it i think over the past three dai i ve oscil between think the suspens is wonder and perfect and think that the ride is wai too rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i would advis my dad to bui on for himself but i ve discov as with the shifter if you take your time with shift you ll have no reason to complain let me explain the ride is worst when turn and appli lot of power to the wheel i feel the wheel scrabbl for traction and torqu steer make the car skitter left and right after i understood thi i avoid the limit of traction and i m a happi camper again it s not bodi rigid but the composur of the car as if match the suspens the steer feel is quit heavi my first impress of drive my sho wa how hard you had to turn the wheel at highwai speed it track straight as an arrow but when drive around a park lot the high effort steer didn t seem so us howev it s reason but it doesn t commun the road to the driver as well as a 1993 ford probe gt imho it s much better than the steer on my celica st i wonder how bad thi car is dure winter miscellan note gripe the rattl from the sunroof is intermitt some dai it rattl loudli other dai i look up wonder where all the nois went activ the sunroof is sometim veri noisi loud squeal as it retract on it rail i wonder if there is a quick fix for thi again other dai it complet disappear function of humid onc i made the connect between the sometim aw feel suspens and torqu steer i ve never complain about ride i wish the seat had more support under the thigh also i wish the side bolster would close more tightli i hear that tire for thi car can get realli expens i current have goodyear gt 4s that cost the previou owner $500 for four i us to hate the ford stereo system whose idea wa it to us a volum paddl now to my amaz i don t realli mind and sometim think it s an okai idea pretti ridicul though get up to 4000 rpm sometim seem to be a chore but thi is no big deal there is more than enough torqu down low i often goof up the shift when drive with friend it took me a coupl of dai befor i could realli shift smoothli from 2nd to 3rd gear hard to believ isn t it my car ha almost 93 000 mile on it my parent note that it is almost imposs to find a low mileag sho astut observ imho i wonder how long i can make my sho last i just bought a book titl drive it forev for tip in thi depart the goofi park brake pedal still throw me for a loop i onc park the car in gear and then accident let out the clutch after i start it the car jolt forward and bounc off the car in front of me no paint damag at all but start the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangl pedal also i began to wonder how strong that brake realli is todai i back out of park spot todai and start to drive awai befor i notic the glow brake light oop the driver s power window creak when close all the wai the same thing happen in my parent 1989 mercuri sabl oddli all the other window work smoothli like i m like the interior amen more and more each dai the cuphold ar great i didn t expect to us the keyless entri button so much but it realli is handi you can lock all the door by press the 7 8 and 9 10 button togeth neat and you can never lock yourself out of the car i realli feel like i don t deserv thi car i realli can t believ that i could afford it i got thi car ten year ahead of schedul i love thi car so much that i ve been tell my parent to look into bui on i love thi car so much that i wrote thi 13k file i meant to write a coupl of line and end up with thi if there were a j d power survei for us car owner i would have an opportun to express my incred satisfact of own thi car i don t like think about get anoth car but at thi point in time i m sure i d bui anoth sho for under $7000 you can t beat it next time with an airbag and ab though insur wise thi car is also a big win i pai the same premium as on my 1987 toyota celica despit that it ha nearli twice the horsepow other odd and end much to my amaz there is no sho mail list anywher mayb becaus the _sho registri_ public ha fill thi void i haven t join yet but i ve notic that queri about sho still appear
