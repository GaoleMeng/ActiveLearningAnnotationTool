i receiv the follow two note from martin hellman with detail on how clipper will work thei ar post with hi permiss the implic of some detail ar fascin date sat 17 apr 93 23 05 23 pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to a long list of recipi subject clipper chip most of you have seen the announc in fridai s ny time etc about nist nation institut of standard technolog announc the clipper chip crypto devic sever messg on the net have ask for more technic detail and some have been labor under understand misunderstand given the lack of detail in the new articl so here to help out is your friendli nsa link me i wa somewhat surpris fridai to get a call from the agenc which suppli mani of the miss detail i wa told the info wa public so here it is the cc of thi to denni branstad at nist is mostli as a doubl check on my fact sinc i assum he is awar of all thi pleas let me know if i have anyth wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embed in silicon each chip will have two secret 80 bit kei on will be the same for all chip ie a system wide kei and the other will be unit specif i don t know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system kei sk and unit kei uk in thi messag the ic will be design to be extrem difficult to revers so that the system kei can be kept secret asid it is clear that thei also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it mai be as much for that as thi state purpos the unit kei will be gener as the xor of two 80 bit random number k1 and k2 uk k1 k2 which will be kept by the two escrow author who these escrow author will be is still to be decid by the attornei gener but it wa stress to me that thei will not be nsa or law enforc agenc that thei must be parti accept to the user of the system as unbias when a law enforc agenc get a court order thei will present it to these two escrow author and receiv k1 and k2 therebi allow access to the unit kei uk in addit to the system kei each user will get to choos hi or her own kei and chang it as often as desir call thi kei plain old k when a messag is to be sent it will first be encrypt under k then k will be encrypt under the unit kei uk and the serial number of the unit ad to produc a three part messag which will then be encrypt under the system kei sk produc e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtain k1 and k2 and thenc k the law enforc agenc will us sk to decrypt all inform flow on the suspect link asid it is my guess that thei mai do thi constantli on all link with or without a court order sinc it is almost imposs to tell which link over which a messag will flow thi give the agenc access to e m k e k uk serial number in the abov messag thei then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which thei have a court order if so thei will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m i am still in the process of assess thi scheme so pleas do not take the abov as ani kind of endors of the propos scheme all i am try to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledg but i will sai that the need for just on court order worri me i would feel more comfort though not necessarili comfort if two separ court order were need on per escrow author while no explan is need the follow stori add some color in research some idea that silvio micali and i have been kick around i spoke with gerald gunther the constitut law expert here at stanford and he relat the follow stori when edward levi becam pre ford s attornei gener right after waterg he wa visit by an fbi agent ask for the wiretap author when levi ask for the detail so he could review the case as requir by law the agent told him that hi predecessor just turn over 40 50 blank sign form everi time levi did not compli and chang the system but the lesson is clear no singl person or author should have the power to author wiretap or wors yet divulg of person kei sometim he or she will be an edward levi and sometim a john mitchel martin hellman date sun 18 apr 93 11 41 42 pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to smb research att com subject re clipper chip it is fine to post my previou messag to sci crypt if you also post thi messag with it in which 1 i ask recipi to be spars in their request further info from me or ask for comment on specif question by thi post i apolog for ani messag i am unabl to respond to i alreadi spend too much time answer too much e mail and am particularli overload thi week with other respons 2 i note a probabl correct sent to me by dorothi den she met with the person from nsa that i talk with by phone so her understand is like to better than mine on thi point where i said the transmit info is e e m k e k uk serial number sk she sai the messag is not doubl encrypt the system kei or famili kei as she wa told it is call onli encrypt the serial number or the serial number and the encrypt unit kei thi is not a major differ but i thought it should be mention and thank her for bring it to my attent it make more sens sinc it cut down on encrypt comput overhead
