you can be a lot better arm if you want to hit what you aim at what seem to be happen here is the situat get total blown out of proport in my post i wa refer to your regular patrolman in a car cruis around the citi vs gang member of cours the polic have access to the thing that you mention but do thei us tank and such all of the time of cours thei don t and that s the point i wa try to make everi dai when i go out to lunch i alwai see cop come in the major that i see ar still carri revolv not that there is anyth wrong with a revolv but if you re a cop that is up against some gang member with a coupl of automat in hi coat i mean semi auto handgun you re go to be at a disadvantag even with train i have been at a shoot rang where gang gang member were practic shoot thei were actual practic take out their gun as quick as possibl and shoot at the target and thei weren t do too badli either the univers cop here who ar ar state cop ar arm better than the chicago polic it seem most state cop ar everi citi and suburban polic offic i ve seen around the twin citi in the last two year ha carri a semi auto of some type differ brand though i haven t seen ani glock s with regard to thi discuss we ar get danger far from the usual rant of t p g and close to the realm of r g but i d like to put my two cent worth in while there s noth wrong with a revolv especi a larg frame s w in 357 magnum my favorit there ar valid advantag to semi auto i suggest read massad ayoob s i know some peopl can t stand him and think he s full of bull but i think that in gener hi materi is veri valid and us book _the semi auto pistol in polic work_ or someth like that he defin a number of wai that semi auto s ar differ and that differ is good the main advantag is not in increas firepow but in more accur followup shot when you go to singl action mode there is also a certain propriatori natur of each gun that take some familiar to learn thi mai have diminish with time as more crimin becom familiar with differ model of semi auto but it wa cite as stop or at least slow down crimin who had grab a polic offic gun defin arm better go shoot a revolv and a semi auto like the colt 45 doe on fire faster than the other nope asid from which faster rate of fire is usual not desir sure it make the other gui duck for cover but just you try hit anyth with a thompson in hose mode thi is why the militari is limit it s m 16 now to 3 round burst fire simpl semi auto would be better but the troop like to be abl to rock and roll even if it is wast of ammo someth often in short suppli when the enemi is plenti a revolv is equal capabl as a semi auto in the same calib a revolv also ha the advantag that if it misfir you just pull the trigger again a doubl action revolv almost all of them can be hand cock first but will fire mere by pull the trigger ye but thi is best done with a two hand hold with a singl hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire doubl action the da semi auto ha the same advantag plu is alwai sa after the first shot a misfir in a revolv mere mean you must pull the trigger again to rotat to the next round i m not sure if thi is meant to be differ from your first point in a da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try drop the hammer on the same round an advantag you don t have in a revolv where the next trigger pull will alwai go to the next round discuss thi point now thi is fine with a dud but what about a hangfir situat grant it s veri rare but your round will now go off confin in the cylind with no place to go slingshot the slide on a misfir take veri littl time a revolv can be carri with the 6th chamber empti and under the hammer for maximum safeti but still can be drawn and fire with an easi motion even on hand actual with modern revolv design incorpor hammer block thi is not necessari or usual recommend a revolv would have to fall hard enough and at the right angl to actual break the hammer and driver the fire pin into the round to set it off speedload for a revolv allow reload almost as fast as magazin on semi auto can be faster depend on user the best speedload user especi those us the spring load speed loader ar veri fast a problem is that eject the spent case is a two hand job where drop the expend magazin is on hand thi mean that while you can be insert a fresh magazin as soon as the old on clear the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motion that will alwai take more time you also don t have the advantag of tactic reload replac a partial magazin to bring you back to full capac the partial magazin can still be us if need later a misfir in a semi auto will requir you to clear a jam shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realiz hei it s jam befor start to do anyth about clear it ye the time to recogn the problem is just as import as the time to clear it realli though in either a revolv or semi auto the odd of an actual misfir with factori ammo ar awfulli small you ar more like to get a jam in a semi auto but even these ar exception rare with modern qualiti gun sig glock et al most semi auto must have the slide work to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some polic carri their semi auto with the chamber load and hammer cock but a safeti engag i do not consid thi safe howev you must trade off safeti to get the same speed of employ as a revolv there ar some doubl action semi auto out there but the complex of oper of mani of them requir more train all common semi auto s can be carri with a round in their chamber without ani safeti problem while i put that out as a statement that i believ i should sai that thi appli to all of the on i ve look at for the da semi s it s no differ from the revolv situat the gun all have hammer or fire pin block thei also have a safeti becaus there s no real advantag carri on of these cock and lock you have the same safeti and speed of employ as a revolv plu the advantag of sa followup shot i m not familiar with sa semi auto except for the 1911 a1 i admit that i wa initi skeptic about carri thi cock and lock but after examin the design try to defeat the safeti gun unload of cours and shoot it a lot i see no inher safeti problem with it especi in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer thi design also get you more speed for an accur first shot than a revolv some polic depart switch to glock and then start quietli switch mani offic back to the old revolv too mani were have accid partli due to the poor train thei receiv not that glock requir rocket scientist but some cop ar baffl by someth as complex as the timer on a vcr yeah the infam glock i still can t figur out how it s wors than a revolv for safeti if you don t pull the trigger it doesn t go off i imagin that if all your revolv shoot wa done doubl action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire befor you realiz it in addit if you had develop that nasti habit of keep your finger on the trigger when holster your gun and reli on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off befor you blew off your foot then you d have problem when the hammer wasn t there anyon who goe anyon sai that the crimin obvious outgun the polic don t know noth about firearm turn off cop and hunter and pai attent i do not seek here to sai semi auto ar junk mere that assum thei ar better for all job is stupid a cop with a revolv on hi hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equip for anyth short of a riot i think thi is even okai for a riot as long as it s a small on b gun control is hit what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you mai find you don t hit anyth good control fire from a revolv is more like to get you a hit i own a 9mm beretta myself but consid it inferior as a carri weapon to someth like the ruger secur six revolv if i haven t hit what i m aim at in the first 5 shot someth is quit serious wrong somewher while i might like have the backup capac of those extra shot in certain case overwhelmingli the of shot fire in crimin encount is less than 5 i have the poor man s beretta tauru 99 and consid it inferior as a carri weapon to the springfield 45 oop 9mm vs 45 argument ar releg to r g you ar right though if you don t hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combin ha fail i don t ascrib failur in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun thi is a shooter failur whether through lack of disciplin or lack of train what do crook overwhelmingli us in crime why the same nice simpl 38 revolv that the polic often us well actual some polic prefer the much heftier 357 magnum but anywai 9mm s ar becom more popular with crook too though the 38 doe still lead the list and like i said around here semi auto s seem the rule for the street cop don t know about the state patrol howev thei mai still carri the highwai patrolman obplea don t flame me i prefer semi auto for most thing but thei introduc unneccessari complic to someth as nerv wrack as an abrupt encount with a lone crimin vincent pleas don t take ani of thi as a flame just my $0 02 whoop look more like $2 00 worth and much of it is imho but do check ayoob s book if everyth had gone as plan everyth would have been perfect
