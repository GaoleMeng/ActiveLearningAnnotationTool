in articl apr 8 00 59 50 1993 28560 atho rutger edu maarten van loon cwi nl maarten van loon write hello fellow netter and fellow christian about the subject of uniti between christian and christian church to a bibl studi group alltough i do have a person opinion on thi issu i thought it would be nice to hear opinion of fellow christian brother and sister from differ countri and in differ situat my background member of a orthodox reform church let us sai a littl the onli uniti i ve found which is true is when all parti involv ar discipl i came out of a church in which even the differ congreg were alwai compet and argu about which on wa better and who had the better messag while none of them put anyth into practic from those messag sinc becom a discipl i ve found that when i travel to anoth church in the same movement thei ar just as accept there as ani other we had a retreat back in januari when some of the congreg from louisvil ky came up thi retreat wa for colleg student and it wa as though i had known even the peopl from louisvil for year and i had onli becom a discipl the previou april and had never been to the church in kentucki on of the kei to uniti is unselfish love and self sacrific that is onli on area in which discipl stand out from christian also anoth part of uniti is a common depth of convict i ve also been a part of some christian campu fellowship who were focus on uniti between church and saw that those church had on thing involv a lack of convict about everyth thei believ that wa why thei could be unifi thei didn t care about the truth but delight in get along togeth the problem here in the netherland is that there ar two other church denomin with the same characterist both have the same confess there ar onli some differ with respect to for exampl the matter of appropri of salvat and how to us our creed in essenc a lot of peopl of these three church have to same faith and feel that thei should becom on church but how that is the question creed what need is there of creed when the bibl stand firmli better so here is a first question can the congreg of christ be separ by wall of differ denomin or is thi definit an untoler situat accord to the scriptur accord to the scriptur split and differ of opinion ar go to be there as per a previou note i mention that there ar those who teach fals by mani mean there ar also differ of opinion and belief howev scriptur state in the follow direct i have no prais for you for your meet do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come togeth as a church there re divis among you and to some extent i believ it no doubt there have to be differ among you to show which of you have god s approv 1 corinthian 11 17 19 how will god show hi approv by fruit see act 2 47 but befor that there ar these qualiti devot to the apostl teach fellowship communion fill with aw for god all have everyth in common glad and sincer heart prais god enjoi the favor of the peopl all these ar mention in act 2 42 47 god also show that those who have these qualiti ar persecut look at stephen a man full of faith and of the holi spirit act 6 5 who wa later stone act 7 54 60 can on sai that onli on of these three church is the true church of jesu christ on can sai that a church is the true church onli if that church is perfect not onli in the congreg but worldwid as a movement i have yet to find that but the closest on i ve found is the boston church of christ movement which constantli strive to have error point out and correct it is also the onli on i ve seen which is total sold out to god a problem close relat to these question is can we cooper with other christian from these two church befor there is a uniti thi question is especi import for those who think that onli on church can be the true on as for cooper that can alwai occur uniti on the other hand mai never occur as for those who think about onli on church be the true on i remind them that mark 9 38 41 state that there ar discipl who ar not a part of the main group to begin with but thei will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i ve heard numer time thi exact same thing that there ar discipl out there that ar not a part of the boston movement but that doe not make them ani less discipl of cours few peopl admit that thei ve ever run into someon who ha the qualiti of a discipl outsid the movement i know i haven t mayb thi last problem sound a littl strang to most of you for your inform we have a lot of organ here which ar found by peopl of on specif church and whose member ar all member of that church thi ha been consid as correct for year onli a few year ago peopl start to discuss about thi and now we ar in the middl of thi process some organ ar open their door for peopl from other church etc i must warn that thi sound cliquei to me a cliqu is a group which run around togeth to some extent exclus thi caus problem in fellowship and caus divis i would not sai at all that thi is someth correct for a church group to do for ani reason in on of the church i attend for exampl there wa an intern cliqu of peopl who were on the 14 differ group committe organiz head of the congreg thei rare talk to anyon els outsid of the committe and seldom were vote out of offic without anoth offic be open up so that thei would have to step right back in their degre of exclus wa such that when the new pastor came he nearli had to wipe out everyth and start from scratch i wish he would ve sinc thei still have no clue about what it mean to be a discipl anywai thi rigid in the cliqu is begin to be broken down but is still there so i must warn against such divis within there s enough divis without thank for your opinion in advanc maarten joe fisher
