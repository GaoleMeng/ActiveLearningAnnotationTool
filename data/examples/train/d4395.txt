in 1993apr4 093904 20517 proxima alt za lucio proxima alt za lucio de re write daric yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice write my point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simpli doe not hold let me give you an exampl how about permit a woman to temporarili leav her job due to pregnanc should that be allow it happen to be sexist as it give a particular right onli to women nevertheless despit the fact that it is sexist i complet support such a law becaus i think it is just fred you re exasper sexism like racial is a form of discrimin us obviou physic or cultur differ to deni on portion of the popul the same right as anoth in thi context your exampl abov hold no water whatsoev there s no discrimin in deni men matern leav in fact i m quit convinc that were anyon to experi with male pregnanc it would be possibl for such a futur father to take leav on medic ground okai i argu thi thoroughli about 3 4 week ago men and women ar differ physic physiolog and psycholog much recent evid for thi statement is present in the book brainsex by ann moir and david jessel i recommend you find a copi and read it their book is an overview of recent scientif research on thi topic and is well referenc now if women and men ar differ in some wai the law can onli adequ take into account their need in these area where thei ar differ by also take into account the wai in which men and women ar differ matern leav is an exampl of thi it take into account that women get pregnant it doe not give women the same rule it would give to men becaus to treat women like it treat men in thi instanc would be unjust thi is just simpli an obviou exampl of where men and women ar intrins differ now peopl make the _naiv_ argument that sexism oppress howev matern leav is sexist becaus men do not get pregnant men do not have the same access to leav that women do not to the same extent or degre and therefor it is sexist no matter howev much a man _want_ to get pregnant and have matern leav he never can and therefor the law is sexist no man can have access to matern leav no matter how hard he tri to get pregnant i hope thi is clear matern leav is an exampl where a sexist law is just becaus the sexism here just reflect the sexism of natur in make men and women differ there ar mani other differ between men and women which ar far more subtl than pregnanc and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex your point that perhap some dai men can also be pregnant is fallaci if men can on dai becom pregnant it will be by have biolog becom women to have a womb and the other factor requir for pregnanc is usual wrap up in the definit of what a woman is so your argument when it is examin is seen to be fallaci you ar sai that men can have the sexist matern leav privileg that women can have if thei also becom women which actual just support my statement that matern leav is sexist the discrimin come in when a woman is deni opportun becaus of her legal determin sexual inferior as i understand most religi sexual discrimin and i doubt that islam is except the femal is not allow into the priestli cast and in gener is subjug so that she ha no aspir to right which as an equal human she ought to be entitl to there is no offici priesthood in islam much of thi function is taken by islam scholar there ar femal islam scholar and femal islam scholar have alwai exist in islam an exampl from earli islam histori is the prophet s widow aisha who wa recogn in her time and is recogn in our time as an islam scholar no matter how sweetli you coat it part of the role of religion seem histor to have serv the function of oppress the femal whether by forc her to procreat to the extent where there is no opportun for self improv or by deni her access to the same facil the male ar offer you have no evid for your blanket statement about all religion and i disput it i could go on and on about women in islam etc but i recent repost someth here under the head islam and women if it is still at your new site i suggest you read it it is repost from soc religion islam so if it ha disappear from alt atheism it still might be in soc religion islam i forgot what it origin titl wa though i will email it to you if you like the roman cathol church is the most blatant of the culprit becaus thei actual istitutionalis a celib clergi but the other religi ar no differ let a woman attempt to escap her role as child bearer and the wrath of god descend on her your statement that other religion ar no differ is i think a statement base simpli on lack of knowledg about religion other than christian and perhap judaism i ll accept your affirm that islam grant women the same right as men when you can show me that ani muslim woman can aspir to the same posit as sai khomeini and there ar no artifici religi or social obstacl on her path to achiev thi aisha who i mention earlier wa not onli an islam scholar but also wa at on stage a militari leader show me the equival of hillari rhodam clinton within islam and i mai consid discuss the issu with you the prophet s first wife who di just befor the hijra the prophet s journei from mecca to medina wa a success businesswoman lucio you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is base on ignor about world religion fred rice daric yoyo cc monash edu au
