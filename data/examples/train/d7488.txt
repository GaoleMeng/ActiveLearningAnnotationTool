in case anyon wa wonder about upgrad their 386 or 486 class machin without spend a lot of monei i look into replac the processor on those machin and here ar the fact as i understand them if you have a ps 2 model 70 or model 80 you can replac the i386 chip with either 1 a cyrix 486dlc chip for $130 which will increas your process power by about 60% for normal fuction and not at all for math function thi chip will onli run at your origin clock speed ie if you have a 16mhz machin the cyrix 486dlc will run at 16mhz note window doe not us the math function so it is a good upgrad if you ar run window or 2 you can get a kingston 486 now platform for $450 with a 25mhz i486sx on it which will increas your normal process power by about 100% if you were run at 25mhz origin but again it will not increas the speed of your math fuction i think that it will continu to run at 25mhz even if your origin processor run at a slower speed there is also 3 the kingston 486 now platform for $750 with a 33mhz i486dx on it thi might speed up your math function as well but i am not sure if you have a ps 2 model 70 b21 or other ps 2 machin with either an i486sx or a non clock doubl i486dx ie it run at either 25 or 33mhz in it then you can get an intel overdr chip which is realli an i486dx2 chip and replac your chip with it you should get about 95% better preform for both normal and math function the 25 50 mhz version of the overdr chip cost $450 and the 33 66mhz version cost $700 the replac for the 25mhz 486sx chip is an espeaci good deal as it provid the math coprocessor which the 486sx doe not have note that the speed rate on the overdr chip ar the maximum speed at which thei can run if you have a 20mhz 486sx then the overdr chip will run at 20 40mhz ie 20mhz extern and 40mhz intern there is no reason to bui an overdr chip which is rate at faster then your machin you will not get faster perform you should be abl to bui these chip from ani of the microchip merchant that advertis at the back of pc magazin or pc week you might want to shop around as price do vari if you need a name phone number for a sourc for a particular chip e mail me and i will respond with a coupl of sourc lawrenc khoo khoo husc3 harvard edu lawrenc khoo comput consult khoo haavelmo harvard edu 617 496 8992 econ dept harvard u
