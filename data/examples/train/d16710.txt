street women prepar lunch men plai card etc some young men usual ag between 17 to 30 year ar member of the lebanes resist even the inhabit of the villag do not know who these ar thei ar secret about it but most peopl often suspect who thei ar and what thei ar up to these young men ar support financi by iran most of the time thei sneak arm and ammunit into the occupi zone where thei set up boobi trap for isra patrol everi time an isra soldier is kill or injur by these trap israel retalli by indiscrimin bomb villag of their own choos often kill onli innoc civilian thi a tri and true method util by guerilla and terrorist group to conduct oper in the midst of the local populac thu forc the oppos state to possibl harm innoc civilian in their search or in order to avoid the death of civilian abandon the search certainli the peopl who us the popul for cover ar also to blaim for drag the innoc civilian into harm s wai ar you suggest that when guerilla us the popul for cover israel should total back down so the easiest wai to get awai with attack anoth is to us an innoc as a shield and hope that the other respect innoc live if israel insist that the so call secur zone is necessari for the protect of northern israel than it will have to pai the price of it occup with the blood of it soldier your damn right israel insist on some sort of demilitar or buffer zone it had to put up with too mani year of attack from the territori of arab state and watch as the state did noth it is not exactli surpriz that israel decid that the onli wai to stop such action is to do it themselv if israel is interest in peac than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will onli occur when arab state show that thei ar prepar to take on the respons and the duti to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil thei have to prove it or provid some guarate there is no wai israel is go to accept their word not with their past attitud of toler toward anti israel guerilla in resid i have written befor on thi veri newsgroup that the onli real solut will come as a result of a comprehens peac settlement wherebi israel withdraw to it own border and peac keep troop ar station along the border to insur no on on either side of the border is shell good lord brad what in the world gove you the idea that un troop stop anyth thei ar onli station in a countri becaus that countri allow them in it can ask them to leav at ani time as nasser did in 56 and 67 somehow with that limit on the troop power i don t think that israel is go to be ani more comfort without a genuin commit to peac from the arab state and concret not intellectu or polit exercis in jargon guarante by other parti the un is worthless to israel but perhap us as a ruse thi is the onli realist solut it is time for israel to realiz that the concept of a buffer zone aim at protect it northern citi ha fail in fact it ha caus much more isra death than the occasion shell of northern israel would have result in perhap you ar awar that to most commun of peopl there is the feel that it is better that mani of us die fight against those who attack us than for few to die while we silent accept our fate if howev you call on israel to see the sens of suffer fewer casualti i suggest you appli the same to palestinian arab and islam group if israel realli want to save some isra live it would withdraw unilater from the so call secur zone befor the conclus of the peac talk such a move would save isra live advanc peac effort give israel a great moral lift better israel s public imag abroad and give it an edg in the peac negoci sinc israel can rightli claim that it is genuin interest in peac and ha alreadi offer some import concess along with such a withdraw israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanes govern and warn that it will not accept ani attack against it northern citi and that if such a shell occur than it will consid re take the buffer zone and will hold the lebanes and syrian govern respons for it from israel s perspect concess get it noth except the realiz that it ha given someth up and now can onli hope that the other side decid to do likewis word can be taken back by mere do so to take back tangibl item land control of land requir the sort of action you sai israel should stai awai from israel put up with attack from arab state territori for decad befor essenti put a stop to it through it invas of lebanon the entir basi of that realiti wa exactli as you state abov 1 israel would express outrag at these attack and protest to the arab state involv 2 that state promptli ignor the entir matter secur in the knowledg that it could not be held respons for the act commit by privat group 3 israel would prepar for the next round of attack what would israel want to return to those dai and don t be so idiot as to suggest trust for the motiv of present dai arab state there seem to be veri littl incent for the syrian and lebanes goovern to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumst ah ok what is differ about the present situat that tell us that the arab state will not pursu their past antagonist polici toward israel now don t talk about vagu polit factor but about those tangibl just like that which israel gave up factor that guarante the respons of those state your assess of differ here is base on a whole lot of assumpt and most state don t feel confort base their exist on that sort of thing and now the lebanes govern ha proven that it is capabl of control and disarm all militia as thei did in all other part of lebanon basil it ha not without the support and activ involv of syria lebanon would not have been abl to accomplish all that ha occur onc syria leav who is to sai that lebanon will be abl to retain control if syria stai thai mai be even more danger for israel tim your view of thi entir matter is far too seren on side and select naiv
