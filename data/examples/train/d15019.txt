i post thi a coupl of week ago and it doesn t seem to have appear on the newsgroup and i haven t had a repli from the moder we were have intermitt problem with our mail at the time pleas excus me if you have seen thi befor should christian fight last week alastair post some question about fight and whether there ar such thing as justifi war i have start look into these thing and have jot down my find as i go i haven t answer all hi question yet and i know what i have here is on a slightli differ tack but possibl i ll be abl to get into it more deepli later and post some more info soon our duti to our neighbour do good to all men gal 6 10 love our neighbour as ourselv matt 22 39 act the part of the good samaritan luke 10 toward ani who mai be in troubl we will therefor render everi possibl assist to an injur man and therefor should not be part of ani organis which caus peopl harm even medic corp of the armi etc christian ar by faith citizen of the commonwealth of israel ephesian 2 11 12 and also recognis that god rule in the kingdom of men and therefor we should not be take part in ani of the struggl of those nation which we ar not part of due to our faith we ar to be stranger and pilgrim amongst the nation so we ar just pass through and not part of ani nation or ani nation aspir thi can also be appli to polit etc but that s anoth stori we ar not suppos to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselv to be defraud it is therefor incosist for us to strive to assist in preserv a state which christ will destroi when he return to set up god s kingdom our duti to the state render therefor unto caesar the thing which be caesar s and unto god the thing which be god s luke 20 25 let everi soul be subject unto the higher power for there is no power but of god the power that be ar ordain of god whosoev resisteth the power resisteth the ordin of god rom 13 1 2 submit yourselv to everi ordin of man for the lord s sake whether it be to king as suprem for so is the will of god that with well do ye mai put to silenc the ignor of foolish men 1 pet 2 13 15 these scriptur make it clear that submiss to the power that be is a divin command but it is equal clear from act 5 19 29 that when ani ordin of man run counter to god s law we must refus submiss to it the reason for thi is that we ar god s bond servant and hi servic is our life s task an exampl of the type of thing is in col 3 22 23 where bondserv were to work heartili as unto the lord so also we should work as if our boss wa god i e press down shaken togeth and run over oop a bit of a side track there in the contest between the nation we ar on god s side a side that is not fight in the battl but is testifi to the truth when we believ in god and embrac hi promis we becom fellow citizen with the saint and of the household of god and ar no longer interest in associ of the world think of thi in relat to union etc as well paul tell us to lai asid everi weight that we mai run the race that is set befor us and if we ar wise we will discard ani associ which would retard our progress thou therefor endur hard as a good soldier of jesu christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affair of thi life that he mai pleas him who hath chosen him to be a soldier 2 tim 2 3 4 on of these entangl he warn about is be ye not unequ yoke togeth with unbeliev on of the obviou applic of thi is marriag with unbeliev but it also cover thing like busi partnership and ani other posit where we mai form a close associ with ani person or person not believ the truth about god in thi case the armi the principl come from deut 22 10 rememb that as well as them be differ anim of differ strength on wa clean and on unclean under the law these idea ar strongli stress in 2 cor 6 13 18 i suggest you read thi the yoke also ha anoth aspect that of servitud and jesu sai take my yoke upon you so we ar then yoke with christ and cannot be yoke with unbeliev we have alreadi seen that we ar bondserv of christ and paul sai becom not ye the bondserv of men 1 cor 7 23 rv an exampl from the old testament the question is ask in 2 chr 19 2 shouldest thou help the ungodli the situat here is a good exampl of what happen when you ar yoke togeth with unbeliev jehoshaphat wa lucki to escap with hi life here ar the fact 1 he had made an affin with ahab who had sold himself to work wicked befor the lord 1 king 21 25 2 when ask by ahab to form a militari allianc he had agre and said i am as thou art my peopl as thy peopl 1 king 22 4 an unequ yoke 3 he sttod firm in refus the advic of the fals prophet and insist on hear the prophet of the lord try to do the right thing he found that he wa yoke and therefor couldn t break awai from the evil associ he had made god sai to us come out from among them and be ye separ and touch not the unclean thing and i will receiv you and ye shall be my son and daughter 2 cor 6 17 thi is more or less what i have found out so far i m still look into it as i don t think i ve answer all the question rais by alastair yet here a summari and a few thing to think about the christian in under command obedi to thi command is an essenti factor in hi relationship with christ john 15 10 14 total dedic to thi cours of action is requir roman 12 1 2 disobedi compromis the close relationship between christ and hi follow 1 pet 2 7 8 we ar to be separ to god rom 6 4 thi involv a master servant relationship rom 6 12 16 no man can serv two master matt 6 24 13 14 all that is in the kosmo is lust and pride quit oppos to go 1 john 2 16 christ kingdom is not of thi world i e not worldli in natur if it wa hi servant would fight to deliv him if christ is our master and he wa not deliv by hi servant becaus hi kingdom wa not of thi world then hi servant cannot possibl fight for anoth master stranger and pilgrim have no right and we cannot swear allegi to anyon but god the servant of the lord must not war but be gentl to all 2 tim 2 24 thi doe not just appli to war but also to avoid strife throughout our live there is a war to be wage not with man s weapon 2 cor 10 3 4 but with god s armour eph6 13 20 i ll probabl post some more when i ve had time to look into thing
