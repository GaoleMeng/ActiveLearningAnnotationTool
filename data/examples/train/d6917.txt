dxb132 psuvm psu edu write scsi i rang from 0 5mb s scsi ii rang from 0 40mb s id rang from 0 8 3mb s esdi is alwai 1 25mb s although there ar some non standard version the abov doe not tell the proper stori of scsi scsi i 8 bit asynchron 1 5mb s av synchron 5mb s max transfer base scsi 1 faster thi requir a scsi 2 control chip and provid scsi 2 8 bit to 16 bit speed with scsi 1 control scsi 2 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst 32 bit wide and fast 16 bit scsi can be wide or fast it depend on how the port is design the quadra will support fast scsi but not wide when the os scsi manag is rewritten sinc the quarda us a scsi 1 non wide port the articl in pc mag 4 27 93 29 wa talk about scsi 1 scsi 2 us ten 10 devic in it nativ mode outsid it nativ mode it behav a lot like scsi 1 7 devic slower through put from your own figur scsi 1 is inde twice esdi as the articl point out as for 20% faster then id that seem to be 8 bit scsi 1 us a scsi 2 contol chip the mac quadra us a scsi 2 control chip for it scsi 1 and get 6mb s through put for asynchron 8 bit scsi 1 far in excess of a normal synchron scsi 1 output 120% of 8 3 is 9 96 which is near the burst of a scsi 1 machin with a scsi 2 control chip the pc world seem to have scsi 1 and scsi 2 mix up fact is scsi 2 control chip allow near scsi 2 speed through a scsi 1 devic as shown in the mac quadra which skew some of the data of scsi 1 vs id or esdi test i agre that the articl could have state that the 20% faster then id came off a scsi 1 devic with a scsi 2 chip mayb it wa there and the editor kill it becaus the articl wa deal with scsi 1 not scsi 2 and he did not understand the effect of a scsi 1 devic with a scsi 2 control chip scsi 1 chip ar limit to 5 mb max scsi 1 devic with scsi 2 chip becom common produc up to 10mb s in 8 bit mode and 20mb s in 16 bit mode the fast version scsi 1 port cannot us wide scsi of courc the prime piec of wierd is that scsi 1 devic have scsi 2 chip or more accur the machin doe thi allow the best of both world high scsi 2 speed and cheeper scsi 1 cost full scsi 2 hardwar port electron control etc is veri expens it also creat a logist nightmar as to how fast scsi 1 goe when on know the fact behind the number then on realiz that the articl know what it is talk about even if it doe not tell how the figur came about while dxb132 psuvm psu edu is throw out rang that don t tell squat sinc he ignor scsi 1 devic with scsi 2 chip hi rang tell even less then intend
