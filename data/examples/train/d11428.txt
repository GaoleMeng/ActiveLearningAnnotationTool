i can think of a coupl of wai of guarante authent in a on time pad encrytp scheme though i m not sure how to prove that what kind of authen thei provid an obviou first attempt might be to prepend a truli random unpredict for ev block to the messag and then calcul a crc which includ the random start block and all of the messag thi could be encrypt after the messag the problem is i m not sure it s imposs to come up with a messag that will hash to the same crc regardless of the random start block it intuit seem like it ought to be hard but i m not that sure clearli a crypto strength hash like md5 or the sha would be stronger but again i m not sure i m comfort claim that it s unbreak a scheme to us up some of the pad bit to decid how mani bit of 0 s to includ in the plaintext stream befor go on wouldn t be too bad either at the cost of increas the speed with which you us up your pad thi could be us to give you arbitrarili low probabl that your oppon could spoof a valid look messag sinc ani deciph plaintext in a spot that should be carri 0 s will show that someth funni s go on if for each messag bit m_i we us up on random bit r_i to decid whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream we d get a total pad us of 2 5 time the messag length we d expand the messag size by about half each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn t is a guess for our would be spoofer at each bit she ha to guess i m try to see how to quantifi her chanc of make it all the wai through the spoof messag but it get a littl complic becaus she can get un synch and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoof messag now i can see a simpl wai of do thi that s got to be as secur as a on time pad at a cost of us 4 time the messag length in pad bit for each messag bit m_i us on random bit r_i and xor them togeth to get x_i now encrypt the three bit with the on time pad the enemi ha no wai of guess what r_i is so he she can t guess what x_i is either ani chang she make in the ciphertext stream will have to involv a guess of what r_i wa is there ani wai to do thi without us so mani pad bit spoof the messag is equival to correctli guess as mani random bit as there ar bit in the messag clearli thi make spoof messag just as hard if you know the whole messag text as if you know none of it in fact it look to me like thi make it just as hard to gener a spoof messag with the ciphertext as without it but i m not entir sure about that is there an easier wai of do thi that s provabl as secur as the on time pad john kelsei
