i wrote in respons to dlecoint garnet acn fsu edu dariu_lecoint it s not clear how much more need to be said other than the faq i think paul s comment on esteem on dai over anoth rom 14 is probabl all that need to be said wa paul a god too is an interpret of the word of paul of higher prioriti than the direct word of jesu in matt5 14 19 paul begin roman 14 with if someon is weak in the faith do you count yourself as on who is weak in the faith i accept that dariu is do what he doe in honor of the lord i just wish he might equal accept that those who esteem all dai alik ar similarli do their best to honor the lord ye but what doe the bibl have to sai what did jesu sai paul close roman 14 with on the other hand the person with doubt about someth who eat it anywai is guilti becaus he isn t act on hi faith and ani failur to act on faith is a sin gau isbn 0 933999 99 2 have you read the ten command which ar a portion of the law have you read jesu word in matt5 14 19 is there ani doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia miss the mark howev i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambigu proof that regular christian worship wa on the first dai as i indic there ar respons on both of the passag cite wherea the ten command and jesu word in matt5 14 19 ar fairli clear ar thei not the difficulti with both of these passag is that thei ar actual about someth els thei both look like thei ar talk about nnregular christian meet but neither explicitli sai and thei gather everi sundai for worship we get variou piec of inform but noth aim at answer thi question matt5 14 19 doesn t answer your question what dai christian met in their hous act 20 7 despit dariu confus is describ by act as occur on sundai it doesn t sai thei gather to see paul off but that when thei were gather for break bread break bread roughli synonym with eat so i think the most obviou read of thi is that on the first dai of everi week simpli mean everi time thei gather for worship how do you unit thi concept of your with the ten command and jesu s word in matt5 14 19 i think the reason we have onli implic and not clear statement is that the nt author assum that their reader knew when christian worship wa clh or thei assum that the ten command and jesu word in matt5 14 19 actual stood for someth perhap thei were strong in the faith no i don t believ that paul can overrul god howev paul wa write for a larg gentil audienc the law wa regard by jew at the time and now as bind on jew but not on gentil there ar rule that were bind on all human be the so call noachic law but thei ar quit minim the issu that the church had to face after jesu death wa what to do about gentil who want to follow christ the decis not to impos the law on them didn t sai that the law wa abolish it simpli acknowledg that fact that it didn t appli to gentil thu there is no contradict with mat 5 as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christian did continu to particip in jewish worship on the sabbath thu thei continu to obei the law the issu wa and is with gentil christian who ar not cover by the law or at least not by the ceremoni aspect of it jesu dealt mostli with jew i think we can reason assum that mat 5 wa direct to a jewish audienc he did interact with gentil a few time e g the centurion whose slave wa heal and a coupl of other the term us to describ the centurion see luke 7 suggest that he wa a god fearer i e a gentil who follow god but had not adopt the whole jewish law he wa commend by jewish elder as a worthi person and jesu accept him as such thi seem to me to indic that jesu accept the prevail view that gentil need not accept the law howev there s more involv if you want to compar jesu and paul on the law in order to get a full pictur of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul s appar reject of the law and how that relat to jesu commend of the law at least as i read paul he sai that the law serv a purpos that ha been in a certain sens superced again thi issu isn t on of the abolit of the law in the middl of hi discuss paul note that he might be understood thi wai and assur us that that s not what he intend to sai rather he see the law as primarili be present to convict peopl of their sin but ultim it s an imposs standard and on that ha been superced by christ paul s comment ar not the world s clearest here and not everyon agre with my read but the interest thing to notic is that even thi radic posit doe not entail an abolit of the law it still remain as an uncompromis standard from which not an iota or dot mai be remov for it purpos of convict of sin it s import that it not be relax howev for christian it s not the end ultim we live in faith not law while the theoret categori thei us ar rather differ in the end i think jesu and paul come to a rather similar conclus the quot passag from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesu show us how he interpret the law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather liter read but in fact that s not jesu approach jesu interpret emphas the intent of the law and stai awai from the ceremoni detail inde he is well known for take a rather free attitud toward the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat 5 17 20 need to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewish discuss jesu accus hi oppon of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that realli matter justic merci and faith and care about how cup and plate ar clean but not about the fact that insid the peopl who us them ar full of extort and rapac mat 23 23 25 thi and the discuss later in mat 5 suggest that jesu ha a veri specif view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength he is think of these aspect of it paul s conclus is similar while he talk about the law be superced all of the specif exampl he give involv the ceremoni law such as circumcis and the sabbath he is quit concern about maintain moral standard the net result of thi is that when paul talk about the law be superced and jesu talk about the law be maintain i believ thei ar talk about differ aspect of the law paul is embroil in argument about circumcis as is natur in letter respond to specif situat he s look at the aspect of the law that is current caus troubl the law as specif jewish ceremoni he certainli doe not intend to abolish divin standard of conduct on the other hand when jesu commend the law he seem to be talk the law in it broadest implic for moral and human relationship and deemphas those aspect that were later to give paul so much troubl it s unfortun that peopl us the same term in differ wai but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the wai term like famili valu take on special mean from the current context imagin some poor historian of the futur try to figur out why famili valu should be us as a code word for opposit to homosexu in on specif period in the u s i think law had taken on a similar role in the argument paul wa involv in paul wa clearli not reject all of the jewish valu that go along with the term law ani more than peopl who concern about the famili valu movement ar realli oppos to famili valu clh
