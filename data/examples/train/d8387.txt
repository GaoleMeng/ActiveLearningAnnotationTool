i believ it goe or will go 680060 powerpc pentium 680040 486 680030 386 680020 286 680000 in a resent articl in on of the macmag i think a 50mhz 030 acceler wa slightli slower than a 25mhz 040 accel but thi is us a system design for the 030 so it stand to reason that a system design for an 040 ie quadra would do better so overal i d figur 040 030 2 5 or so along the same line the new powerpc stuff is suppos to run the system at the level of a fast quadra but system 8 or whatev will allow 3 time the speed of a 040 in the powerpc base system and wait for the 680060 i think it lap the pentium pro life pro women michael amer internet michael amer f204 n2603 z1 fidonet org
