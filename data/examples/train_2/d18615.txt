robert weiss psyrobtw ubvmsb cc buffalo edu write rick anderson repli to my letter with ra in articl c5elp2 l0c acsu buffalo edu ra psyrobtw ubvmsb cc buffalo edu robert weiss sai ra just briefli on someth that you mention in pass you refer to differ interpret of creat and sai that mani christian mai not agre so what that is realli irrelev we do not base our faith on how mani peopl think on wai or anoth do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popular of opinion it mai be irrelev to you and your person belief or should i sai bia but it is relev to me and mani other you re right the bottom line is truth independ from you or anyon els sinc you proclaim truth as a self proclaim appointe mai i ask you by what author you do thi becaus it sai so in the bibl doe the bibl sai so or is it you or someon els who interpret whether a scriptur or doctrin conform to your particular like or disapprov excus moi but your line of truth haven t move me on bit to persuad me that my belief ar erron of all the preacher of truth on thi net you have struck me as a self righteou member of the wreck crew with no posit messag to me or other latter dai saint whatsoev btw thi entir discuss remind me a lot of the thing said by jesu to the pharise ye hypocrit s ye preach about me with your lip but your heart ar far remov from me also i find it rather strang that in try to persuad that creat and etern exist ar equival you sai grant the mormon belief you can t grant your conclus and then expect the point to have been address in order to repli to the issu you have to address and answer the point that wa rais and not just jump to the conclus that you grant sophistri look who s talk jump to conclus you wouldn t do that yourself right all you address is your own convict regardless whether we come up with ani biblic scriptur which support our point of view becaus you reject such interpret without ani consider whatsoev the bibl state that lucif wa creat the bibl state that jesu is the creator of all the contradict that we have is that the ld belief is that jesu and lucif were the same a beauti exampl of disinform and a deliber misrepresent of ld doctrin the former kgb would have love to emploi you jesu and lucif ar not the same silli and you know it the mormon belief is that all ar children of god liter there is noth symbol about it thi howev contradict what the bibl sai the bibl teach that not everyon is a child of god correct it mai contradict would you think the bibl sai the bibl inde doe teach that not all ar children of god in the sens that thei belong to or follow god in hi footstep satan and hi follow have rebel against god and ar not children follow redeem of god but it doesn t mean that thei were not onc creat by god but chose to separ themselv from those who chose to follow god and hi plan of salvat the field is the world the good seed ar the children of the kingdom but the tare ar the children of the wick on matthew 13 38 so thi illustr nice what i just said the children of the kingdom ar those who have remain valiant in their testimoni of jesu and have shown work of repent etc and the children of the wick on ar those who rebel against god and the lamb the issu of satan s spirit offspr and those who follow him ha not been address in thi and other vers you copi from your bibl you purposefulli obscur the subject by swamp your right with non relat scriptur lot of nice scriptur delet not robert w copyright though ra we ar told that and thi is life etern that thei might know ra thee the onli true god and jesu christ whom thou hast sent ra john 17 3 life etern is to know the onli true god yet the ra doctrin of the ld that i have mention portrai a vastli ra differ jesu a jesu that cannot be reconcil with the jesu of ra the bibl thei ar so far remov from each other that to proclaim correct my jesu is inde differ than your jesu and can be reconcil with the jesu in the bibl not your interpret of him i concur but i honestli couldn t care less ra on as be true deni the other from be true accord to the ra bibl etern life is depend on know the onli true god and ra not the construct of imagin in thi singl post of your i ve seen more construct of imagin than in all of the pro ld mail combin i have read so far in thi new group first get your ld fact straight befor you dare preach to us about the onli true god whom you interpret accord to your own like and dislik but whose imag i cannot reconcil with what i know about him myself i guess your grandios self imag doe not allow for other faith believ in the divin of jesu christ but in a differ wai or fashion than your own not that it realli matter the mission and progress of the ld church will go on boldli and nobli and no mob or oppon can stop the work from progress until it ha visit everi contin swept everi clime and sound in everi ear thi is realli a red her it doesn t address ani issu rais but rather it seek to obfusc the fact that some group try to read someth into the bibl doesn t chang what the bibl teach sigh what the bibl teach or what the bibl teach accord to robert weiss and co i respect the former i reject the latter without the remotest feel that i have reject jesu on the contrari and by the wai i do respect your interpret of the bibl i even grant you be a christian follow your own imag of him as much as i am a christian follow my own imag of him in my heart most of the other repli have instead hop scotch to the issu of bruce mcconki and whether hi view were offici doctrin i don t think that it matter if mcconki s view were canon that is not the issu were mcconki s write indic of mormon belief on thi subject is the real issu the indic from rick is that thei mai certainli be the issu is of cours that you love to us anyth to either mi repres or ridicul the ld church the issu of offici doctrin is obvious veri import mcconki s view have been controversi e g the seven deadli heresi ha made me a heret at best or erron at worst black not to receiv the priesthood in thi dispens i respect him as someon who ha made hi valuabl contribut to the church but i person do not reli on hi person interpret hi book mormon doctrin is oftentim refer to as mcconki s bibl in mormon circl on mormon doctrin i rather look to offici doctrin sourc and to hugh niblei s book the last comment is an ld insid refer summar mcconki wa a wise man who contribut undoubtedli far more to the kingdom of god than i have but whose view ar by no mean dogma or accept doctrin some of it clearli belong to person interpret and specul but have said thi i find mcconki even in hi most bias and specul moment far more thought provok than the trash come from your proverbi pen i m somewhat appal that i have allow myself to sink as low as you in thi post robert weiss
