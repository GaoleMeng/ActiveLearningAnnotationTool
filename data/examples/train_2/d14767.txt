michael bushnel write the so call creed of athanasiu howev ha alwai been a western creed and ha alwai had the filioqu the orthodox have said that thei accept all that it sai with the except of the filioqu but it is not in us which is exactli what i point out though i wa wrong about your us of the creed the 1913 cathol encylcopedia in which i read about it said the orthodox do us the creed minu the filioqu appar that ha chang the athanasian creed ha alwai had the filioqu the nicen constantinopolitan did not of cours the orthodox did not delet the filioqu from the nicen creed it wasn t there to begin with but thei certainli did from the athanasian creed which did have it from the begin i might point out that the whole problem start over the differ in wai of explain the gener of the bless triniti the east emphas the idea of the holi spirit proceed from the father through the son and the west us proceed from the father and the son in fact some such as tertullian us both formul see below follow therefor the form of these exampl i profess that i do call god and hi word the father and and hi son two for the root and the stem ar two thing but conjoin the fountain and the river ar two kind but indivis the sun and the rai ar two form but coher on anyth which proce from anoth must necessarili be a second to that from which it proce but it is not on that account separ from it where there is second howev there ar two and where ther is third there ar three the spirit then is third from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the rai tertullian against praxea 8 5 about 213 ad and i believ that the spirit proce not otherwis than from the father through the son tertullian against praxea 4 1 about 213 ad and as st thoma show in hi summa theologica part 1 question 36 articl 2 and 3 there is no contradict between the two method of gener and in fact the two method of reckon the process emphas what st augustin among other taught that the holi spirit proce from the father and the son but he proce from the father in a more preemin wai for whatev the son ha he ha from the father certainli he ha it from the father that the holi spirit proce from him for the father alon is not from anoth for which reason he alon is call unbegotten not inde in the scriptur but in the practic of theologian and of those who emploi such term as thei ar abl in a matter so great the son howev is born of the father and the holi spirit proce princip from the father and sinc the father give to the son all that he ha without ani interv of time the holi spirit proce jointli from both father and son he would be call son of the father and of the son if which is abhor to everyon of sound mind thei had both begotten him the spirit wa not begotten by each howev but proce from each and both st augustin of hippo the triniti 15 26 47 400 to 416 ad so in a sens all of the formul ar correct to the west at least becaus the holi spirit proce from both father and son but in proceed from the son the orgin of that process is the process from the father so the holi spirit is proceed from the father through the son but as all that the son ha is from the father the holi spirit can be said to proce from the father without ani mention of the son be necessari in ani case i am happi to know that i follow in the belief of pope st leo i st fulgenc of rusp st cyril of alexandria pope st damsu i st augustin of hippo st epiphaniu of salami st ambros of milan st hilari of poitier tertullian and other among the father who all have veri quotabl quot support the cathol posit which i enunci abov as for the issu of the adopt of anoth creed be forbidden i will point out that the holi father of ephesu and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbid anyon to produc write or compos a confess of faith other than the on defin by the father of nicea that creed is a differ creed than that of constantinopl which is commonli call the nicen creed not of cours in that thei were condemn the adopt of the constantinopolitan creed which is but an enlarg upon the creed of nicea but that thei were condemn the impiou opinion of nestori who had adopt a radic differ creed from the on us by the church which among other thing deni the process of the holi spirit form the son thu the addit of the constantinopolitan creed were not thought to be in violat of thi and as the council chalcedon also affirm the doctrin of the process of the holi spirit from the son which nestoriu deni thei could hardli have been against explain in a fuller wai the creed for thei themselv approv of previou addit to it and if the further explan of the creed made in constantinopl were not denigr of the work done by the holi father of nicea or in ani wai heret it follow that the council of toledo wa fulli abl to add what wa not disput by the faith to the creed so as to combat the impieti of the arian in spain becaus the filioqu wa not in disput in the church until mani year later under photiu and other and that the filioqu wa not disput i provid more quot below sinc the holi spirit when he is in us effect our be conform to god and he actual proce from the father and son it is abundantli clear that he is of the divin essenc in it in essenc and proceed from it st cyril of alexandria the treasuri of the holi and consubstanti triniti thesi 34 423 425 ad the holi spirit is not of the father onli or of the son onli but he is the spirit of the father and the son for it is written if anyon love the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again it is written if anyon howev doe not have the spirit of christ he is none of hi when the father and the son ar name in thi wai the holi spirit is understood of whom the son himself sai in the gospel that the holi spirit proce from the father and that he shall receiv of mine and shall announc it to you pope st damasu i the decre of damasu 1 382 ad the onli begotten holi spirit ha neither the name of the son nor the appel of father but is call holi spirit and is not foreign to the father for the onli begotten himself call him the spirit of the father and sai of him the he proce from the father and will receiv of mine so that he is reckon as not be foreign to the son but is of their same substanc of the same godhead he is spirit divin of god and he is god for he is spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesi like soul and bodi in us but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son a third by appel the father alwai exist and the son alwai exist and the spirit breath from the father and the son and neither is the son creat nor is the spirit creat st epiphaniu of salami which is on cypru the man well anchor 8 and 75 374 ad concern the holi spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet is it necessari to speak still on account of those who do not know him it is not possibl for me to be silent howev it is necessari to speak of him who must be acknowledg who is from the father and the son hi sourc st hilari of poitier the trintii 2 29 356 to 359 ad thu as i have point out befor gaul spain itali africa egypt palastin and the land of the greek all of christnedom at that time all have father who can be cite to show that thei confess the doctrin express by the filioqu i suggest to those of the orthodox church that thei come up with some of the father besid st john of damascu who all will admit deni the filioqu to support their view it is not enough to bring up the proce from the father line of the creed or the gospel of john for that sai what we believ also but it doe not sai the holi spirit doe not proce from the son onli that he doe proce from the father andi byler
