the follow partial summari of a theori of the univers includ a littl known descript of the creation of our solar system larsonian astronomi and physic orthodox physicist astronom and astrophysicist claim to be look for a unifi field theori in which all of the forc of the univers can be explain with a singl set of law or equat but thei have been systemat ignor or suppress an excel on for 30 year the late physicist dewei b larson s comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers which he call the reciproc system is built on two fundament postul about the physic and mathemat natur of space and time 1 the physic univers is compos entir of on compon motion exist in three dimens in discret unit and in two reciproc form space and time 2 the physic univers conform to the relat of ordinari commut mathemat it magnitud ar absolut and it geometri is euclidean from these two postul larson develop a complet theoret univers us variou combin of translat vibrat rotat and vibrat rotat motion the concept of in ward and out ward scalar motion and speed in relat to the speed of light which larson call unit veloc and the natur datum at each step in the develop larson wa abl to match object in hi theoret univers with object in the real physic univers photon sub atom particl incomplet atom charg atom molecul globular star cluster galaxi binari star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar etc even object not yet discov then such as explod galaxi and gamma rai burst and appli hi theori to hi new model of the atom larson wa abl to precis and accur calcul inter atom distanc in crystal and molecul compress and thermal expans of solid and other properti of matter all of thi is describ in good detail with out fanci complex mathemat in hi book book of dewei b larson the follow is a complet list of the late physicist dewei b larson s book about hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers some of the earli book ar out of print now but still avail through inter

properti of matter 1988 all but the last of these book were publish by north pacif publish p o box 13255 portland or 97213 and should be avail via inter librari loan if your local univers or public librari doesn t have each of them sever of them includ the last on ar avail from the intern societi of unifi scienc isu 1680 e atkin av salt lake citi utah 84106 thi is the organ that wa start to promot larson s theori thei have other relat public includ the quarterli journal reciproc physicist dewei b larson s background physicist dewei b larson wa a retir engin chemic or electr he wa about 91 year old when he di in mai 1989 he had a bachelor of scienc degre in engin scienc from oregon state univers he develop hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers while try to develop a wai to comput chemic properti base onli on the element us larson s lack of a fanci ph d degre might be on reason that orthodox physicist ar ignor him but it is not a valid reason sometim it take a rel outsid to clearli see the forest through the tree at the same time it is clear from hi book that he also knew orthodox physic and astronomi as well as ani physicist or astronom well enough to point out all their contradict ad hoc assumpt principl of impot in consist etc larson did not have the fund etc to experiment test hi theori and it wa not necessari for him to do so he simpli compar the variou part of hi theori with other research experiment and observ data and in mani case hi explan fit better a self consist theori is much more than the orthodox physicist and astronom have thei claim to be look for a unifi field theori that work but have been ignor on for over 30 year now modern physic doe not explain the physic univers so well some part of some of larson s book ar full of quotat of lead orthodox physicist and astronom who agre and rememb that epicycl crystal sphere geocentr flat earth theori etc also onc seem to explain it well but were later prove conceptu wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritu of uw superior wa is a strong propon of larson s theori and wa or still is presid of larson s organ the intern societi of unifi scienc and editor of their quarterli journal reciproc he move to minneapoli after retir super collid boondoggl i am against contruct of the superconduct super collid in texa or anywher els it would be a gross wast of monei and contribut almost noth of scientif valu most physicist don t realiz it but accord to the comprehens gener unifi theori of the late physicist dewei b larson as describ in hi book the strang goofi particl meson hyperon alleg quark etc which thei ar find in exist collid fermi lab cern etc ar realli just atom of anti matter which ar creat by the high energi collid beam and which quickli disintegr like cosmic rai becaus thei ar incompat with their environ a larger and more expens collid will onli creat a few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not seen there befor and the physicist will be even more confus than thei ar now ar a few more type of anti matter atom worth the $8 3 billion cost don t we have much more import us for thi wast monei anoth thing to consid is that the primari propos locat in texa ha a seriou and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insul off underground cabl how much poison of the ground and ground water with insecticid will be requir to keep the ant out of the supercollid name the super collid after ronald reagon as propos is total absurd if it is built it should be name after a lead particl physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers anti matter is not a simpl case of opposit charg of the same type of particl it ha more to do with the rate of vibrat and rotat of the photon of which thei ar made in relat to the vibrat and rotat equival of the speed of light which larson call unit veloc and the natur datum in larson s theori a positron is actual a particl of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotat vibrat charg and rotat of their respect photon of which thei ar made neutral each other in larson s theori the anti matter half of the physic univers ha three dimens of time and onli on dimens of space and exist in a reciproc relationship to our materi half larsonian rel the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercuri ha been observ and precis measur to advanc at the rate of 574 second of arc per centuri 531 second of thi advanc ar attribut via calcul to gravit perturb from the other planet venu earth jupit etc the remain 43 second of arc ar be us to help prove einstein s gener theori of rel but the late physicist dewei b larson achiev result closer to the 43 second than gener rel can by instead us special rel in on or more of hi book he appli the lorentz transform on the high orbit speed of mercuri larson total reject gener rel as anoth mathemat fantasi he also reject most of special rel includ the part about mass increas near the speed of light and the us of the lorentz transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift greater than 1 000 realli ar move faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is awai from us in time in larson s comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers there ar three dimens of time instead of onli on but two of those dimens can not be measur from our materi half of the physic univers the on dimens that we can measur is the clock time at low rel speed the valu of the other two dimens ar neglig but at high speed thei becom signific and the lorentz transform must be us as a fudg factor larson often us the term coordin time when write about thi in regard to mass increas it ha been proven in atom acceler that acceler drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceler is acceler forc mass a f m orthodox physicist ar ignor the third factor forc in larson s theori mass stai constant and forc drop toward zero forc is actual a motion or combin of motion or relat between motion includ inward and outward scalar motion the expans of the univers for exampl is an outward scalar motion inher in the univers and not a result of the so call big bang which is yet anoth mathemat fantasi the univers of motion i wish to recommend to everyon the book the univers of motion by dewei b larson 1984 north pacif publish p o box 13255 portland oregon 97213 456 page index hardcov it contain the astrophys portion of a gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by that author an unrecogn geniu more than thirti year ago it contain final solut to most all astrophys mysteri includ the format of galaxi binari and multipl star system and solar system the true origin of the 3 degre background radiat cosmic rai and gamma rai burst and the true natur of quasar pulsar white dwarf explod galaxi etc it contain what astronom and astrophysicist ar all look for if thei ar readi to serious consid it with open mind the follow is an exampl of hi theori s success in hi first book in 1959 the structur of the physic univers larson predict the exist of explod galaxi sever year befor astronom start find them thei ar a necessari consequ of larson s comprehens theori and when quasar were discov he had an immedi relat explan for them also gamma rai burst astro physicist and astronom ar still scratch their head about the mysteri gamma rai burst thei were origin thought to origin from neutron star in the disc of our galaxi but the new gamma rai telescop now in earth orbit ha been detect them in all direct uniformli and their sourc locat in space do not correspond to ani known object except for a few case of direct coincid gamma rai burst ar a necessari consequ of the gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewei b larson accord to page 386 of hi book the univers of motion publish in 1984 the gamma rai burst ar come from supernova explos in the anti matter half of the physic univers which larson call the cosmic sector becaus of the relationship between the anti matter and materi halv of the physic univers and the wai thei ar connect togeth the gamma rai burst can pop into our materi half anywher in space seemingli at random thi is why the sourc locat of the burst do not correspond with known object and come from all direct uniformli i wonder how close to us in space a sourc locat would have to be for a gamma rai burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no wai to predict on nor to stop it perhap some of the mass extinct of the past which ar now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid were actual caus by nearbi gamma rai burst larsonian binari star format about half of all the star in the galaxi in the vicin of the sun ar binari or doubl but orthodox astronom and astrophysicist still have no satisfactori theori about how thei form or why there ar so mani of them but binari star system ar actual a like consequ of the comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewei b larson i will try to summar larson explan which is detail in chapter 7 of hi book the univers of motion and in some of hi other book first of all accord to larson star do not gener energi by fusion a small fraction come from slow gravit collaps the rest result from the complet annihil of heavi element heavier than iron each element ha a destruct temperatur limit the heavier the element is the lower is thi limit a star s intern temperatur increas as it grow in mass via accret and absorpt of the decai product of cosmic rai gradual reach the destruct temperatur limit of lighter and lighter element when the intern temperatur of the star reach the destruct temperatur limit of iron there is a type i supernova explos thi is becaus there is so much iron present and that is relat to the structur of iron atom and the atom build process which larson explain in some of hi book better than i can when the star explod the lighter materi on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier materi in the center portion of the star wa alreadi bounc around at close to the speed of light becaus of the high temperatur the explos push that materi over the speed of light and it expand outward in time which is equival to inward in space and it often actual disappear for a while over long period of time both mass start to fall back gravitation the materi that had been blown outward in space now start to form a red giant star the materi that had been blown outward in time start to form a white dwarf star both star then start move back toward the main sequenc from opposit direct on the h r diagram the chanc of the two mass fall back into the exact same locat in space make a singl lone star again ar near zero thei will instead form a binari system orbit each other accord to larson a white dwarf star ha an invers densiti gradient is densest at it surfac becaus the materi at it center is most wide dispers blown outward in time thi elimin the need to resort to mathemat fantasi about degener matter neutron star black hole etc larsonian solar system format if the mass of the heavi materi at the center of the explod star is rel small then instead of a singl white dwarf star there will be sever mini white dwarf star revolv around the red giant star but probabl still too far awai in three dimension time to be affect by it heat etc these will becom planet in chapter 7 of the univers of motion larson us all thi inform and other principl of hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers to deriv hi own version of bode s law black hole fantasi i heard that physicist stephen w hawk recent complet a theoret mathemat analysi of two black hole merg togeth into a singl black hole and conclud that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two origin black hole such a result should be recogn by everyon as a red flag caus widespread doubt about the whole idea of black hole etc after read physicist dewei b larson s book about hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers especi hi book the univers of motion it is clear to me that black hole ar noth more than mathemat fantasi the strang object at cygnu x 1 is just an unusu massiv white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronom and physicist so badli want to prove their theori by the wai i do not understand why so much public is be given to physicist stephen hawk the physicist and astronom seem to be act as if hawk s sever physic problem somehow make him wiser it doe not i wish the same attent had been given to physicist dewei b larson while he wa still aliv widespread public and attent should now be given to larson s theori book and organ the intern societi of unifi scienc electro magnet propuls i heard of that concept mani year ago in connect with ufo s and unorthodox inventor but i never wa abl to find out how or why thei work or how thei ar construct i found a possibl clue about why thei might work on page 112 113 of the book basic properti of matter by the late physicist dewei b larson which describ part of larson s comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers i quot on paragraph as indic in the preced chapter the develop of the theori of the univers of motion arriv at a total differ concept of the natur of electr resist the electron we find ar deriv from the environ it wa brought out in volum i larson s book noth but motion that there ar physic process in oper which produc electron in substanti quantiti and that although the motion that constitut these electron ar in mani case absorb by atom structur the opportun for util thi type of motion in such structur ar limit it follow that there is alwai a larg excess of free electron in the materi sector materi half of the univers most of which ar uncharg in thi uncharg state the electron cannot move with respect to extens space becaus thei ar inher rotat unit of space and the relat of space to space is not motion in open space therefor each uncharg electron remain perman in the same locat with respect to the natur refer system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationari spatial refer system the uncharg electron like the photon is carri outward at the speed of light by the progress of the natur refer system all materi aggreg ar thu expos to a flux of electron similar to the continu bombard by photon of radiat meanwhil there ar other process to be discuss later wherebi electron ar return to the environ the electron popul of a materi aggreg such as the earth therefor stabil at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theori uncharg electron ar also massless and ar basic photon of light of a particular frequenc abov the unit frequenc spin around on axi at a particular rate below the unit rate unit veloc is the speed of light and there ar vibrat and rotat equival to the speed of light accord to larson s theori i might have the abov and below label mix up larson is sai that outer space is fill with mass less un charg electron fly around at the speed of light if thi is true then the electro magnet propuls field of spacecraft might be abl to interact with these electron or other particl in space perhap give them a charg and mass and shoot them toward the rear to achiev propuls in larson s theori an electr charg is a on dimension rotat vibrat of a particular frequenc abov the unit frequenc superimpos on the rotat of the particl the paragraph quot abov might also give a clue to confus meteorologist about how and why lightn is
