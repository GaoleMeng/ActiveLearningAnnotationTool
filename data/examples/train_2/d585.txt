record reliabl mileag etc some other owner on the ford probe world std com mail list have comment about thi problem but i haven t seen it happen on my 3 month old 93 probe gt i think thi mai be someth that ford ha correct sinc the initi batch of car also someon said that ford ha issu a servic bulletin to inform dealer about how to correct thi problem so you mai be abl to get your dealer to fix it i have had my probe look at twice by my local dealer where i purchas the car the first time thei made thi problem wors the second time after advis them of the servic bulletin mention on my ford probe mail list thei said thei didn t know of the bulletin thei adjust the window and made it much better howev it now make a scritch scritch nois on rough road and still squeal when i open close the window in wet weather anyon els s do thi ford onli give 1 kei with the car c mon ford spend an extra few penni i got two kei with my car but onli on remot entri push button thingi but then i bought my 93 with 2500 mile and i think it mai have been a repossess so i m not surpris someth wa miss horn button behind air bag in spoke and not in center person prefer i am serious consid follow the advic in the owner manual where it describ the procedur to follow if you discov someth on your ford that could caus seriou injuri threaten live etc someth about notifi the nation traffic safeti group as well as ford those littl you ve got to posit the finger perfectli to make it beep button ar terribl the latter is probabl becaus of the air bag it s pretti much take up all the space where you d expect to find the horn speak of the horn i wa surpris to find that the probe come with on of those nice merican sound horn instead of the japanes sound kind the previou probe had japanes horn well i guess that s good in a wai but in a wai it s bad when someon hear that kind of horn thei expect to see a big american car thei mai not associ the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe is tire fling dirt mud onto side of car yeah not veri badli but enough to be annoi sometim the mudflap help a lot transmiss the 5 speed is a must i have alwai been a 5 speed gui almost everi car i ve ever own ha been a 5 speed becaus i got a good deal on thi car with the 2500 mile i knowingli overlook the fact that it ha an automat but it is a pretti high tech automat it is a fulli electronicali control 4 speed with torqu convert lockup even with the automat i m get 35 mpg on the highwai drive 65 70 but of cours drive 65 is illeg so i probabl made that sentenc up around town the mileag ha been around 25 27 not bad for an automat of cours it doesn t have the control of a 5 speed but sinc i do a lot of citi drive it turn out to be veri conveni it s nice to be abl to drink a cup of coffe and drive at the same time although that too is illeg here in we like to control your life massachusett no shake rattl nois when go over bump pothol still shake and rattl ha been my main gripe i ve gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattl when it get older tire 225 55vr16 goodyear eagl 70% left hope for 30k on my 89 probe gl i got about 40k out of the origin goodyear and had driven the replac tire bridgeston 50k mile when i trade the car the 195 65 60 vr14 fireston on my 93 probe look like thei re design for perform ie rather wide shallow tread etc so thei probabl won t last as long but the car handl veri veri veri well it stick to the road like glue even on a rough surfac interior is veri veri nice too veri pleas to the ey and ergonom sound definit ford mazda did a veri veri nice job on thi on the car ha a much more expens than it actual is look and feel to it ye thi car s stiff suspens isn t for everyon i person like it but if you find it a littl harsh but otherwis like the car i d strongli suggest look into the mx 6 have driven an 89 probe for 4 year i find the 93 suspens interest the car actual drive much better than the 89 it is a veri firm ride and you definit know about each and everi bump in the road yet the car remain veri civil on even the bumpiest road you hear and feel the bump yet the car retain it postur veri well if you have 3 passeng by all mean bring them along too thei ll find that thei have no room in the back and you ll find that the car ride differ if that s better is up to you well i wouldn t encourag passeng carri in the probe unless the person in the front seat like to sit with hi knee to the dash as mention in the consum report write up consid the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggi to me though if it had been i d not have bought the car but it s definit not a famili car also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expect the temperatur insid the car get pretti hot in the summer a c is a must on ani probe from 89 93 the 93 in particular send out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max that lot of glass you mention is what give the car the veri good visibl report you see in all the write up most sport sporti car don t have that good visibl i ve heard that the exhaust system ha troubl but mine work fine i haven t heard about thi on i know that some of the veri earli probe 89 and mayb 90 had problem with prematur rust muffler which the complaint i ve heard re exhaust system on 93 s have been on the gt of cours be a differ engin that is a differ exhaust system i wa on of those with an 89 who qualifi for the free replac sinc i had alreadi replac the muffler when i receiv the notic i wa am due a refund from ford i appli in februari and am still wait gave me a free rental car for the dai and a half that i wa without my car i wa quit happi with the wai thei handl especi consid that i wa expect the worst from them ye i wa pretti amaz when i had my car in for some touch up adjust thi past week and thei had to keep it overnight too busi for them to get to it and thei offer to pai for a rental thei did make me pai for tax and insur though from what i ve heard it sound like ford mazda had some qc problem with the probe and probabl mx 6 when thei first went into product but i think these problem have mostli been correct at thi point that s almost alwai to be expect with a complet new car like thi though i have to agre that thei seem to have some qc problesm but i serious feel the car design is sound and expect it to do veri well bill heiser heiser ac bu edu heiser world std com boston univers boston ma
