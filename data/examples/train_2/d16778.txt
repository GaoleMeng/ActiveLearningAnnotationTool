jewish peopl veri imag and creativ jewish religion wa the foundat for christian and islam in other word judaism ha father both religion now islam ha turn against it father i mai sai it is iron that after communizem threat is almost gone religion war ar go to be on the rais i thought the idea of believ on on god wa to unit all man kind how come both jew and islam which believ on the same god the god of ebrahim ar kill each other is thi like dr frankenstien s stori how ar you go to stop thi from happen how ar you go to deal with so mani muslim nuke them would distroi the whole world would god get mad sinc you have kill hi follow you believ on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all what is the peaceful wai of end thi saga judaism did not father islam we had mani of the same prophet but judaism ignor prophet later prophet includ jesu christ who christian and muslim believ in and moham the idea of believ in on god should unit all peopl howev note that christian and islam reflect the fact that there ar peopl with differ view and the right of non christian and non muslim ar state in each religion man kind need religion sinc it set up the rule and the regul which keep the societi in a healthi state a religion is mostli a set of rule which peopl have experienc and know it work for the societi the prai keep the sole healthi and medit it god doe not care for man kind prai but man kind hope that god will help him when he prai religion work mostli on the moral issu and try to put awai the materialist thing in the life but the religi leader need to make a live through religion so thei mai corrupt it or turn it to their own wai to make their live i e muslim have to pai %20 percent of their incom to the mullah i guess the rabi get hi cut too we ar suppos to pai 6% of our incom after all necess ar paid pleas note that thi 6% is on a person basi if you ar poor there is no need to pai quit the contrari thi monei most often goe to the poor in each in countri and to the poor muslim around the world also thi monei is not requir in the human sens i e a muslim never knock at your door to ask for monei and nobodi make a list at the mosqu to make sure you have paid and we sure don t pass monei basket around dure our prayer servic is in it that religion should be such that everybodi on planet earth respect each other be good toward each other help on anoth respect the mother natur is in that heaven and hell ar creat on earth through the act that we take todai is in it that within everi man there is good and bad he could choos either on then he will see the outcom of hi choic how can we prevent man kind from go crazi over religion how can we stop anoth religi kill field under poor god name what ar your thought do you think man kind would to come it sens befor it is too late p s on the side do you think that mose saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he creat the earth he could have been anywher why on top the mountain wa it becaus peopl thought to see god you have to reach to the ski heaven why god kept come back to middl east wa it becaus thei creat god through their imagin is that why jewish peopl were told by god thei were the chosen on god s presenc is certainli on earth but sinc god is everywher god mai show sign of exist in other place as well we can not sai for sure where god ha shown sign of hi exist and where he ha not profit mohammad wa marri to khadijeh she wa a jewish she taught him how to trade she probabl taught him about judaism quran is mostli copi right of taurah sp old testement do you think god wrote quran makeh wa a trade citi befor islam do you think it wa made to be the center of islam world becaus mohammad want to expand hi trade busi is that why god ha put hi hous in there the qur an is not a copyright of the taurah muslim believ that the taurah the bibl and the qur an origin contain much the same messag thu the mani similiar howev the taurah and the bibl have been translat into other languag which ha chang their mean over time a translat also reflect some of the person view of the translat s the qur an still exist in the same languag that it wa reveal in arab therefor we know that mankind ha not chang it mean it is truli what wa reveal to moham at that time there ar mani scientif fact which were not discov by tradit scientif method until much later such as the develop of the babi in the mother s womb i think thi religi stuff ha gone too far all man kind ar go to hurt from it if thei do not wise up look at david koresh how that turn out i am afraid in the bigger scale the jew and the muslim will have the same end onli god know for sure how it will turn out i hope it won t but if that happen it wa the will of god religion is need in the sens to keep peopl in harmoni and keep them do good thing rather than plot each other distruct there is on earth on life and on god let s all man kind be good toward each other god help us all peac pleas send thi
