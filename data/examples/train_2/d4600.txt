s also entir possibl that hitler wa ly when he claim to believ in god we certainli can t conclud that he s an atheist though subject the bibl prove it typic post in the bibl it sai that respons most of the reader of alt atheism feel that the bibl is of question accuraci as it wa written thousand of year ago by mani author who were record oral tradit that exist mani year befor thu ani claim truth in it is of question legitimaci thi isn t to sai that the bibl ha no truth in it simpli that ani truth must be examin befor be accept mani of the reader of thi group also feel that becaus ani passag is subject to interpret ani claim that a passag mean on thing and on thing onli is not legitim note that thi feel tend to extend to other book it is also remark to mani atheist that theist tend to ignor other equal plausibl religi book in favour of those of their own religion subject pascal s wager typic post if you believ in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost noth but if you don t believ in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefor it is foolish to be an atheist respons thi argument is known as pascal s wager it ha sever flaw firstli it doe not indic which religion to follow inde there ar mani mutual exclus and contradictori religion out there thi is often describ as the avoid the wrong hell problem if a person is a follow of religion x he mai end up in religion y s version of hell secondli the statement that if you believ in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost noth is not true suppos you re believ in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolish consid also the death that have result from peopl reject medicin in favour of prayer anoth flaw in the argument is that it is base on the assumpt that the two possibl ar equal like or at least that thei ar of compar likelihood if in fact the possibl of there be a god is close to zero the argument becom much less persuas so sadli the argument is onli like to convinc those who believ alreadi also mani feel that for intellectu honest peopl belief is base on evid with some amount of intuit it is not a matter of will or cost benefit analysi formal speak the argument consist of four statement 1 on doe not know whether god exist 2 not believ in god is bad for on s etern soul if god doe exist 3 believ in god is of no consequ if god doe not exist 4 therefor it is in on s interest to believ in god there ar two approach to the argument the first is to view 1 as an assumpt and 2 as a consequ of it on problem with thi approach in the abstract is that it creat inform from no inform thi is consid invalid in inform theori statement 1 indic on ha no inform about god but statement 2 indic that benefici inform can be gain from the absolut lack of inform about god thi violat inform entropi inform ha been extract from no inform at no cost the altern approach is to claim that 1 and 2 ar both assumpt the problem with thi is that 2 is then basic an assumpt which state the christian posit and onli a christian will agre with that assumpt the argument thu collaps to if you ar a christian it is in your interest to believ in god a rather vacuou tautolog and not the wai pascal intend the argument to be view the biggest reason why pascal s wager is a failur is that if god is omnisci he will certainli know who realli believ and who believ as a wager he will spurn the latter assum he actual care at all whether peopl believ in him subject what is occam s razor typic post peopl keep talk about occam s razor what is it respons william of occam formul a principl which ha becom known as occam s razor in it origin form it said do not multipli entiti unnecessarili that is if you can explain someth without suppos the exist of some entiti then do so nowadai when peopl refer to occam s razor thei gener express it more gener for exampl as take the simplest solut the relev to atheism is that we can look at two possibl explan for what we see around us 1 there is an incred intric and complex univers out there which came into be as a result of natur process 2 there is an incred intric and complex univers out there and there is also a god who creat the univers clearli thi god must be of non zero complex given that both explan fit the fact occam s razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solut number on unfortun some argu that there is a third even more simpl solut 3 there isn t an incred intric and complex univers out there we just imagin that there is thi third option lead us logic toward solips which mani peopl find unaccept subject why it s good to believ in jesu typic post i want to tell peopl about the virtu and benefit of my religion respons preach is not appreci feel free to talk about your religion but pleas do not write post that ar on a convers theme such post do not belong on alt atheism and will be reject from alt atheism moder try the newsgroup talk religion misc you would doubtless not welcom post from atheist to your favourit newsgroup in an attempt to convert you pleas do unto other as you would have them do unto you often theist make their basic claim about god in the form of lengthi analog or parabl be awar that atheist have heard of god and know the basic claim about him if the sole purpos of your parabl is to tell atheist that god exist and bring salvat you mai as well not post it sinc it tell us noth we have not been told befor subject why i know that god exist typic post i know from person experi and prayer that god exist respons just as mani theist have person evid that the be thei worship exist so mani atheist have person evid that such be do not exist that evid vari from person to person furthermor without wish to dismiss your evid out of hand mani peopl have claim all kind of unlik thing that thei have been abduct by ufo visit by the ghost of elvi and so on subject einstein and god doe not plai dice typic post albert einstein believ in god do you think you re clever than him respons einstein did onc comment that god doe not plai dice with the univers thi quotat is commonli mention to show that einstein believ in the christian god us thi wai it is out of context it refer to einstein s refus to accept the uncertainti indic by quantum theori furthermor einstein s religi background wa jewish rather than christian a better quotat show what einstein thought about god is the follow i believ in spinoza s god who reveal himself in the orderli harmoni of what exist not in a god who concern himself with fate and action of human be einstein wa unabl to accept quantum theori becaus of hi belief in an object orderli realiti a realiti which would not be subject to random event and which would not be depend upon the observ he believ that qm wa incomplet and that a better theori would have no need for statist interpret so far no such better theori ha been found and much evid suggest that it never will be a longer quot from einstein appear in scienc philosophi and religion a symposium publish by the confer on scienc philosophi and religion in their relat to the democrat wai of life inc new york 1941 in it he sai the more a man is imbu with the order regular of all event the firmer becom hi convict that there is no room left by the side of thi order regular for caus of a differ natur for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divin will exist as an independ caus of natur event to be sure the doctrin of a person god interf with natur event could never be refut ital hi in the real sens by scienc for thi doctrin can alwai take refug in those domain in which scientif knowledg ha not yet been abl to set foot but i am convinc that such behavior on the part of repres of religion would not onli be unworthi but also fatal for a doctrin which is to maintain itself not in clear light but onli in the dark will of necess lose it effect on mankind with incalcul harm to human progress in their struggl for the ethic good teacher of religion must have the statur to give up the doctrin of a person god that is give up that sourc of fear and hope which in the past place such vast power in the hand of priest in their labor thei will have to avail themselv of those forc which ar capabl of cultiv the good the true and the beauti in human itself thi is to be sure a more difficult but an incompar more worthi task einstein ha also said it wa of cours a lie what you read about my relig convict a lie which is be systemat repeat i do not believ in a person god and i have never deni thi but have express it clearli if someth is in me which can be call religi then it is the unbound admir for the structur of the world so far as our scienc can reveal it the latter quot is from albert einstein the human side edit by helen duka and banesh hoffman and publish by princeton univers press also from the same book i do not believ in immort of the individu and i consid ethic to be an exclus human concern with no superhuman author behind it of cours the fact that einstein chose not to believ in christian doe not in itself impli that christian is fals subject everyon worship someth typic post everyon worship someth whether it s monei power or god respons if that is true everyon is a polytheist theist care just as much about those thing that atheist care about if the atheist reaction to for exampl their famili amount to worship then so do the theist subject why there must be a causeless caus typic post set of integ that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chain of caus must all have a first element a causeless caus respons the set of real number greater than zero ha a definit lower bound but ha no smallest member further even if it is true that there must be a causeless caus that doe not impli that that caus must be a consciou supernatur entiti and especi not that ani such entiti must match the descript favour by ani particular religion subject the univers is so complex it must have been design typic post the presenc of design in the univers prove there is a god sure you don t think all thi appear here just by chanc respons thi is known as the argument from design it is a matter of disput whether there is ani element of design in the univers those who believ that the complex and divers of live creatur on the earth is evid of a creator ar best advis to read the newsgroup talk origin for a while there is insuffici space to summar both side of that debat here howev the conclus is that there is no scientif evid in favour of so call scientif creation furthermor there is much evid observ and theori that can explain mani of the complex of the univers and life on earth the origin of the argument by design is a feel that the exist of someth as incred intric as sai a human is so improb that sure it can t have come about by chanc that sure there must be some extern intellig direct thing so that human come from the chao deliber but if human intellig is so improb sure the exist of a mind capabl of fashion an entir univers complet with consciou be must be immeasur more unlik the approach us to argu in favour of the exist of a creator can be turn around and appli to the creationist posit thi lead us to the familiar theme of if a creator creat the univers what creat the creator but with the addit of spiral improb the onli wai out is to declar that the creator wa not creat and just is or wa from here we might as well ask what is wrong with sai that the univers just is without introduc a creator inde stephen hawk in hi book a brief histori of time explain hi theori that the univers is close and finit in extent with no begin or end the argument from design is often state by analog in the so call watchmak argument on is ask to imagin that on ha found a watch on the beach doe on assum that it wa creat by a watchmak or that it evolv natur of cours on assum a watchmak yet like the watch the univers is intric and complex so the argument goe the univers too must have a creator the watchmak analog suffer from three particular flaw over and abov those common to all argument by design firstli a watchmak creat watch from pre exist materi wherea god is claim to have creat the univers from noth these two sort of creation ar clearli fundament differ and the analog is therefor rather weak secondli a watchmak make watch but there ar mani other thing in the world if we walk further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldn t assum it wa creat by the watchmak the argument would therefor suggest a multitud of creator each respons for a differ part of creation final in the first part of the watchmak argument we conclud that the watch is not part of natur becaus it is order and therefor stand out from the random of natur yet in the second part of the argument we start from the posit that the univers is obvious not random but show element of order the watchmak argument is thu intern inconsist subject independ evid that the bibl is true typic post the event of the new testament ar confirm by independ documentari evid for exampl respons the write of josephu ar often mention as independ documentari evid earli version of josephu s work ar thought not to have mention jesu or jame the extant version discuss john in a non christian context mani scholar believ that the origin mention jesu and jame in pass but that thi wa expand by christian copyist sever reconstruct of the origin text have been publish to thi effect much inform appear in the ecclesiast histori of eusebiu about 320 c e it is worthless as histor materi becaus of the deliber falsif of the wili eusebiu who is gener acknowledg as the first thoroughli dishonest historian of antiqu it is eusebiu who is gener given the titl of authorship for thi materi asid from the new testament the biograph inform about jesu is more well document for further inform pleas consult the frequent ask question file for the newsgroup soc religion christian subject godel s incomplet theorem typic post godel s incomplet theorem demonstr that it is imposs for the bibl to be both true and complet respons godel s first incomplet theorem sai that in ani consist formal system which is suffici express that it can model ordinari arithmet on can formul express which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or fals within that formal system technic speak the system must also be recurs that is there must be a decis procedur for determin whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system essenti all such system can formul what is known as a liar paradox the classic liar paradox sentenc in ordinari english is thi sentenc is fals note that if a proposit is undecid the formal system cannot even deduc that it is undecid the logic us in theolog discuss is rare well defin so claim that godel s incomplet theorem demonstr that it is imposs to prove or disprov the exist of god ar worthless in isol on can trivial defin a formal system in which it is possibl to prove the exist of god simpli by have the exist of god state as an axiom thi is unlik to be view by atheist as a convinc proof howev it mai be possibl to succe in produc a formal system built on axiom that both atheist and theist agre with it mai then be possibl to show that godel s incomplet theorem hold for that system howev that would still not demonstr that it is imposs to prove that god exist within the system furthermor it certainli wouldn t tell us anyth about whether it is possibl to prove the exist of god gener note also that all of these hypothet formal system tell us noth about the actual exist of god the formal system ar just abstract anoth frequent claim is that godel s incomplet theorem demonstr that a religi text the bibl the book of mormon or whatev cannot be both consist and univers applic religi text ar not formal system so such claim ar nonsens subject georg bush on atheism and patriot typic post did georg bush realli sai that atheist should not be consid
