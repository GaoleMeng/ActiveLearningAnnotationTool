the onli wai to view thi method of gener unit kei is as a back door what els can you call a kei determinist gener from the serial number to gener the unit kei for a serial number n the 30 bit valu n is first pad with a fix 34 bit block to produc a 64 bit block n1 s1 and s2 ar then us as kei to tripl encrypt n1 produc a 64 bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarli n is pad with two other 34 bit block to produc n2 and n3 and two addit 64 bit block r2 and r3 ar comput r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 ar then concaten togeth give 192 bit the first 80 bit ar assign to u1 and the second 80 bit to u2 the rest ar discard the unit kei u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 ar the kei part that ar separ escrow with the two escrow agenc what happen is that the need for the escrow hous is complet elimin or should i sai the need to _access_ the escrow hous to decrypt the data the hous will still serv a real purpos as far as gener the illus of protect and small town cop won t be let in on the secret so thei will still go through the motion of go to the escrow hous but the fact is __the feder govern can and will build a chip which gener the unit kei from the encrypt serial number __ nuff said
