thi is a continu of an earlier post ml panix com michael siemon write for those christian who do think that some part of leviticu can be law for christian while other ar not even to be thought about it is incumb on you in everi case handl on it own merit to determin why you pick on and ignor anoth i frankli think the whole effort misguid reread paul no doubt i am free to do anyth but christian have a criterion to us for make our judgment on thi the great command of love for god and neighbor if you cannot go through leviticu and decid each command there on that basi then your own arbitrari select from it is simpli idiosyncraci in thi context it is remark offens to sai i notic that the vers forbid bestial immedi follow the vers prohibit what appear to be homosexu intercours i am sorri you found thi offens it wa not my intent to offend i wa lead up to anoth point which i discuss in more detail below well la ti da so what thi is almost as slimei an argument as the on that homosexu rape i know of no on who argu serious though on can alwai find joker in defens of bestial it is absolut irrelev and incompar to the issu gai christian do rais which concern sexual activ within commit consensu human adult realtionship so that your bring it up is no more relev than the law of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issu you ar be bloodi dishonest in trail thi red her in front of the world if you want to address bestial that is your busi not mine and attempt to torpedo a seriou issu by us what is in our cultur a ridicul joke show that you have no interest in hear us as human be you want to dismiss us and us the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so i can see you have a revuls for bestial that far exce my distast for homosexu certainli if i spoke about homosexu the wai you speak of bestial nobodi would have ani troubl label me a homophob let me ask thi gentli why ar you so judgement of other peopl s sexual prefer what happen to no doubt i am free to do anyth i think you have a seriou doubl standard here when you describ a comparison between homosexu and bestial as slimei and sleazi you ar make an implicit judgement that bestial is pervert sin disgust unnatur in short all the thing that societi onc thought about homosexu not all peopl share your view you claim not to know ani sincer zoophil but thi doe not mean that thei do not exist thei even have their own newsgroup alt sex bestial ar you go to accus them all of be mere joker i notic you delet the main point of my comment the fact that the onli biblic condemn of bestial occur in connect with the levit prohibit against homosexu while there ar some new testament passag that can arguabl be taken as condemn homosexu there ar none that condemn bestial on of your main point seem to be that christian homosexu is accept due to the lack of ani clear new testament statement against it if thi is a valid argument then should not christian zoophilia be made that much more accept by the fact that the new testament make no refer clear or unclear to the subject at all i am quit seriou here if i am go to accept homosexu as biblic accept on the basi of your argument then i am go to be fair and appli the same standard to everyon els s declar sexual prefer as well if the argument you make for homosexu can be appli to other sexual prefer as well i m go to appli them and see what come up i m not try to torpedo a seriou issu by us what you label a ridicul joke i post a question about how we should interpret biblic guidelin for christian sexual and i don t think such a question is irrelev in a group call soc religion christian the bibl discuss homosexu and bestial togeth in the same context and therefor i feel i have a good preced for do the same jesu and paul both expound veri explictli and in consider length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we ar requir to love on anoth and all els depend on that gai and lesbian christ ian challeng you to address the issu on those term and all we get in return ar cheap debat trick attempt to side track the issu i don t know whether it make ani differ but for the record thi is not a side issu for me i believ love on anoth includ not encourag peopl to defil themselv therefor it is of high import to determin whether god regard certain sexual act as defil i can read in the new testament that god ha join togeth heterosexu coupl and that the marriag bed is undefil i can read in the old testament that homosexu intercours and bestial defil a person whether or not that person is under the law if gai christian can validli put asid the old testament standard of defil then i want to know so that i can fairli appli it to all the sexual practic that defil a person in the old dai i don t think it s right to take just bit and piec of the law and try and appli them to christian todai e g bestial still defil you but homosexu doesn t that wa pretti much what you said earlier right you us differ exampl but i think you said essenti the same thing about it be wrong to appli onli certain part of the law to christian christian no doubt veri sincer on keep show up here and in everi corner of usenet and the world and all thei ever do is spout these same old vers which thei obvious have never thought about mayb never even read in total ignor of the issu rais slander us with the vilest charg of child abus or whatev their perfervid mind can manag to conjur up toss out red her with thei suppos great emot forc to caus reader to dismiss our wit without even take the troubl to find out what it is it wa not my intent to stir up such an emot reaction i person don t get all that upset discuss altern to the monogam heterosexu orient i m afraid i naiv assum that other would have a similar attitud pleas note that i have never intend to equat homosexu with child abus i have mere note that for all the lack of clear nt condemn of homosexu there is an even greater lack of nt condemn or even mention of bestial a practic which a number of peopl e g on alt sex bestial consid to be their true sexual orient such behavior should shame anyon who claim to have seen truth in christ why for god s preciou sake do you peopl quot irrelev vers to condemn peopl you don t know and won t even take the troubl to listen to befor you start your condemn is that love your neighbor god forbid is that how you obei the repeat command to not judg or condemn other christ and paul spend order of magnitud more time in insist on thi than the half dozen obscur word in paul that you ar so bloodi readi to take as licens to do what god tell you not to do why for god s sake quot from john 3 17ff omit for breviti thi is an excel question and i prai that you will not treat it as a mere rhetor question but will genuin seek to discov and understand the answer i recommend you begin with a littl introspect into why you yourself have much the same attitud toward zoophilia why do you find bestial so repugn that you regard it as slander to even mention in connect with other altern sexual orient why do you not appli all the same vers about love and toler to zoophil the wai you appli them to homosexu is it becaus you automat experi a subject feel of revuls at the thought a lot of peopl have the same experi at the thought of homosexu intercours is it becaus you regard the practic as social unaccept a lot of peopl regard homosexu as social unaccept do you feel that it violat the tradit judeo christian standard of sexual moral mani peopl feel that homosexu doe do you feel the bibl condemn it mani peopl think the bibl sai more to condemn homosexu than it doe to condemn bestial why then do you think compar bestial with homosexu is insult to homosexu if you can honestli answer thi question you will have come a long wai toward understand why mani peopl feel the same wai about homosexu as you feel about bestial also pleas note that i am not in ani sens condemn peopl i am mere point out that when i read the bibl i see certain sexual practic that the bibl appear to condemn e g sex outsid of marriag when i sai i think adulteri and pre marit sex ar sin do you take that as me fail to love my neighbor when you treat bestial as someth disgust and unmention ar you disobei repeat order not to judg or condemn other when you sai other christian ar guilti of sin by condemn you and judg you ar you by that accus make yourself guilti of the same offens or ar you and i both simpli take note about practic the bibl brand as sin and leav the judgement of the peopl up to god for long ag we mani of us have been confus by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shame and reject some of us despair and took to cours that probabl do show a sin shun of god s light bless ar those whose spirit have been crush by the self righteou thei shall be justifi howev we have seen the truth and the truth is the light of human and we now know that it is not we who fear the light but our enemi who fear the light of our wit and will do everyth thei can to shadow it with the dark of fals wit against us michael l siemon i sai you ar god son of the ml panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall ml ulyss att com like ani princ psalm 82 6 7 i m not sure what you mean by the abov two paragraph if you mean that jesu is the truth and that he accept sinner and doe not reject them then i agre if we were not sinner then we would not need a savior our salvat in christ howev doe not mean that sin is now irrelev for us and we can now do whatev we want nor doe christ s grace mean that those who refer to sin as sin ar be judgement or intoler i am speak in gener term here not specif about homosexu if the bibl call someth sin then it is not unreason for christian to call it sin too as appli to christian homosexu i think the onli definit author on christian sexual is the bibl if you make a list of everyth the bibl sai on the subject of homosexu intercours i think you will find that everi vers on the list is neg and condemn at worst and unclear at best the most pro gai statement you could make about the list is that there is some disput about the new testament vers which mani peopl interpret as condemn homosexu intercours that is from a gai perspect the most posit thing you can sai about the bibl s treatment of homosexu is that some vers fail to clearli condemn it that s it jesu declar all food clean the council at jerusalem declar that gentil were not requir to keep the ritual law but nobodi ever reclassifi homosexu intercours from be an abomin deserv of death to be an accept christian practic you have vers describ homosexu intercours as an abomin that defil both jew under the law and gentil not under the law and you have some vers which ar at best not clear but which some peopl believ ar clear in their condemn of homosexu behavior and that s the sum total of what the bibl sai about same sex intercours i can appreci from person experi your desir to have everyth simpl cut and dri black and white what i want is ok and those who oppos me ar wick howev i do not think the bibl make your case as definit as you would like it to in fact i don t believ it sai anyth posit about your case at all ye i know the vers about love on anoth and not judg on anoth but that s not realli the issu is it you know and admit that there ar still thing that ar sin for christian to do sinc you sai it is wrong for christian to condemn you therefor the issu is whether the bibl sai homosexu intercours is a sin even if you do challeng the clariti of the new testament vers you ar still left with the fact that the onli thing the bibl doe sai clearli about homosexu intercours is that it is an abomin that defil both those who ar under the law and those who ar not mark actual i don t think the reaction to the comparis with bestial is base on bestialophobia i think what he regard as slimei is the rhetor approach of connect homosexu and bestial most peopl who accept homosexu take a radic approach to the law thei regard all of lev as not bind on christian the argument is that there s no wai in the text to separ bestial homosexu and wear mix fabric thi doe not mean that such peopl have no limit on their conduct nor doe it mean that thei accept bestial it simpli mean that their sexual ethic doe not come from the law and particularli not from lev clh
