jpeg stand for joint photograph expert group the origin name of the committe that wrote the standard jpeg is design for compress either full color or grai scale digit imag of natur real world scene it doe not work so well on non realist imag such as cartoon or line draw jpeg doe not handl black and white 1 bit per pixel imag nor doe it handl motion pictur compress standard for compress those type of imag ar be work on by other committe name jbig and mpeg respect jpeg is lossi mean that the imag you get out of decompress isn t quit ident to what you origin put in the algorithm achiev much of it compress by exploit known limit of the human ey notabl the fact that small color detail aren t perceiv as well as small detail of light and dark thu jpeg is intend for compress imag that will be look at by human if you plan to machin analyz your imag the small error introduc by jpeg mai be a problem for you even if thei ar invis to the ey a us properti of jpeg is that the degre of lossi can be vari by adjust compress paramet thi mean that the imag maker can trade off file size against output imag qualiti you can make extrem small file if you don t mind poor qualiti thi is us for index imag archiv make thumbnail view or icon etc etc convers if you aren t happi with the output qualiti at the default compress set you can jack up the qualiti until you ar satisfi and accept lesser compress 2 why us jpeg there ar two good reason to make your imag file smaller and to store 24 bit per pixel color data instead of 8 bit per pixel data make imag file smaller is a big win for transmit file across network and for archiv librari of imag be abl to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 kbyte or so make a big differ in disk space and transmiss time if you ar compar gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to on more detail below if your view softwar doesn t support jpeg directli you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipul imag even with a jpeg capabl viewer it take longer to decod and view a jpeg imag than to view an imag of a simpler format gif for instanc thu us jpeg is essenti a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an imag more cheapli it s worth note that when network or phone transmiss is involv the time save from transfer a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmet yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradual replac gif as a standard usenet post format is that jpeg can store full color inform 24 bit pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer color if you have onli 8 bit displai hardwar then thi mai not seem like much of an advantag to you within a coupl of year though 8 bit gif will look as obsolet as black and white macpaint format doe todai furthermor for reason detail in section 7 jpeg is far more us than gif for exchang imag among peopl with wide vari color displai hardwar henc jpeg is consider more appropri than gif for us as a usenet post standard 3 when should i us jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not go to displac gif entir for some type of imag gif is superior in imag qualiti file size or both on of the first thing to learn about jpeg is which kind of imag to appli it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for store full color or grai scale imag of realist scene that mean scan photograph and similar materi jpeg is superior even if you don t have 24 bit displai hardwar and it is a lot superior if you do see section 7 for detail gif doe significantli better on imag with onli a few distinct color such as cartoon and line draw in particular larg area of pixel that ar all exactli the same color ar compress veri effici inde by gif jpeg can t squeez these file as much as gif doe without introduc visibl defect thi sort of imag is best kept in gif form in particular singl color border ar quit cheap in gif file but thei should be avoid in jpeg file jpeg also ha a hard time with veri sharp edg a row of pure black pixel adjac to a row of pure white pixel for exampl sharp edg tend to come out blur unless you us a veri high qualiti set again thi sort of thing is not found in scan photograph but it show up fairli often in gif file border overlaid text etc the blurri is particularli objection with text that s onli a few pixel high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it comput drawn imag rai trace scene for instanc usual fall between scan imag and cartoon in term of complex the more complex and subtli render the imag the more like that jpeg will do well on it the same goe for semi realist artwork fantasi draw and such plain black and white two level imag should never be convert to jpeg you need at least about 16 grai level befor jpeg is us for grai scale imag it should also be note that gif is lossless for grai scale imag of up to 256 level while jpeg is not if you have an exist librari of gif imag you mai wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a littl imag qualiti if you do section 7 which argu that jpeg imag qualiti is superior to gif onli appli if both format start from a full color origin if you start from a gif you ve alreadi irretriev lost a great deal of inform jpeg can onli make thing wors howev the disk space save mai justifi convert anywai thi is a decis you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif librari to jpeg see section 14 for hint be prepar to leav some imag in gif format sinc some gif will not convert well 4 how well doe jpeg compress imag pretti darn well here ar some sampl file size for an imag i have handi a 727x525 full color imag of a ship in a harbor the first three file ar for comparison purpos the rest were creat with the free jpeg softwar describ in section 6b file
