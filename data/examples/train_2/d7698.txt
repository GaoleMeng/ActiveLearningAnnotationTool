thi poll wa conduct to help user decid whether or not to alter their iisi clock oscil i have attempt to gather as mani case histori as possibl to find some estim of success and risk the number of repli probabl show how rare thi modif is but give the impress that success rate mai be higher than the previou 80% estim 24 of 24 machin were abl to run at 25 mhz when no add on board were present thi is not a scientif survei but it is the best we have to work with thank to all who contribut to thi poll issu speed 25 mhz to 27 5 mhz appear to be the norm for machin without add on card all report machin were abl to us 25 mhz as long as no add on card were present sever appl nubu card were in us no machin with the nubu adapt wa abl to go faster than 25 mhz on wasn t even abl to achiev 25 mhz with the nubu adapt in place at speed of 32 and 33 mhz the startup sound is distort and hi densiti floppi disk problem have been report note unless specif list below machin were not test with a higher speed clock to failur henc the 25 mhz oper machin mai well work at higher speed damag on user report pull out the plate of on pad thi wa repair and the machin is oper on other report pull the pin out of the origin clock oscil dure desold there is on second hand report of a user put a gash in the motherboard with a slip solder iron no report of static discharg damag no report of high speed oper caus damag then again i also don t have ani report from user of defect parachut add on board compat appear to be a problem with appl nubu adapt sever other add on board have been us with success see case histori heat sink virtual all modifi machin had a heat sink instal these were often the to 220 style power transistor type some us epoxi some us a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacryl glue there wa also us of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the motherboard case histori all speed ar the effect cpu speed 1 2 of clock oscil all report cpu version were 20 mhz 1 27 5 mhz oper ran for 10 minut at 31 mhz befor crash no fpu or other add on card heatsink cpu onli on 24 hour dai no damag dure instal 2 27 5 mhz oper without appl nubu adapt 25 mhz top speed with appl nubu card instal heatsink cpu onli on 24 hour dai no floppi problem no damag dure instal 3 27 5 mhz oper unabl to boot at 31 mhz heatsink cpu onli no floppi problem no damag dure instal 4 25 mhz oper work with the follow two configur a
