sandvik newton appl com kent sandvik write my onlin bibl is on a cd but i don t own a cd rom system for the time be so i can t search for the famou cite where jesu explicitli state that he didn t want to break exist jewish law in other word technic speak christian should us saturdai and not sundai as their holi dai if thei want to conform to the teach of jesu i think the passag you re look for is the follow matthew 5 17 think not that i have come to abolish the law and the prophet i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew 5 18 for truli i sai to you till heaven and earth pass awai not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplish matthew 5 19 whoever then relax on of the least of these command and teach men so shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven but he who doe them and teach them shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven matthew 5 20 for i tell you unless your righteous exce that of the scribe and pharise you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there ar sever problem with thi the most seriou is that the law wa regard by jew at the time and now as bind on jew but not on gentil there ar rule that were bind on all human be the so call noachic law but thei ar quit minim the issu that the church had to face after jesu death wa what to do about gentil who want to follow christ the decis not to impos the law on them didn t sai that the law wa abolish it simpli acknowledg that fact that it didn t appli to gentil thi is a simpl answer which i think just about everyon can agre to a discuss of the issu in more or less these term is record in act 15 howev there s more involv in order to get a full pictur of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul s appar reject of the law and how that relat to jesu commend of the law at least as i read paul he sai that the law serv a purpos that ha been in a certain sens superced again thi issu isn t on of the abolit of the law in the middl of hi discuss paul note that he might be understood thi wai and assur us that that s not what he intend to sai rather he see the law as primarili be present to convict peopl of their sin but ultim it s an imposs standard and on that ha been superced by christ paul s comment ar not the world s clearest here and not everyon agre with my read but the interest thing to notic is that even thi radic posit doe not entail an abolit of the law it still remain as an uncompromis standard from which not an iota or dot mai be remov for it purpos of convict of sin it s import that it not be relax howev for christian it s not the end ultim we live in faith not law while the theoret categori thei us ar rather differ in the end i think jesu and paul come to a rather similar conclus the quot passag from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesu show us how he interpret the law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather liter read but in fact that s not jesu approach jesu interpret emphas the intent of the law and stai awai from the ceremoni detail inde he is well known for take a rather free attitud toward the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat 5 17 20 need to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewish discuss jesu accus hi oppon of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that realli matter justic merci and faith and care about how cup and plate ar clean but not about the fact that insid the peopl who us them ar full of extort and rapac mat 23 23 25 thi and the discuss later in mat 5 suggest that jesu ha a veri specif view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength he is think of these aspect of it paul s conclus is similar while he talk about the law be superced all of the specif exampl he give involv the ceremoni law such as circumcis and the sabbath he is quit concern about maintain moral standard the net result of thi is that when paul talk about the law be superced and jesu talk about the law be maintain i believ thei ar talk about differ aspect of the law paul is embroil in argument about circumcis as is natur in letter respond to specif situat he s look at the aspect of the law that is current caus troubl the law as specif jewish ceremoni he certainli doe not intend to abolish divin standard of conduct on the other hand when jesu commend the law he seem to be talk the law in it broadest implic for moral and human relationship and deemphas those aspect that were later to give paul so much troubl it s unfortun that peopl us the same term in differ wai but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the wai term like famili valu take on special mean from the current context imagin some poor historian of the futur try to figur out why famili valu should be us as a code word for opposit to homosexu in on specif period in the u s i think law had taken on a similar role in the argument paul wa involv in paul wa clearli not reject all of the jewish valu that go along with the term law ani more than peopl who concern about the famili valu movement ar realli oppos to famili valu
