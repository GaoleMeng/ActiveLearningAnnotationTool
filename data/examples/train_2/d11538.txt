here is a revis version of my summari that correct some error and provid some addit inform and explan thank you veri much after read the text some distinct question aris to me which i guess will also be ask by other peopl perhap would it be interest to find an answer to these question the clipper chip a technic summari n a 30 bit serial number thi length is subject to chang shorter or longer onc the session kei k is establish the clipper chip is us to encrypt the convers or messag stream m digit voic the telephon secur devic feed k and m into the chip to produc two valu e m k the encrypt messag stream and e e k u n f a law enforc field which ar transmit over the telephon line the law enforc field thu contain the session kei k encrypt under the unit kei u concaten with the serial number n all encrypt under the famili kei f the law enforc field is decrypt by law enforc after an author wiretap ha been instal first question when will the lawenforcmentfield be transmit and how doe the remot clipper chip handl it is it transmit period in the stream of encrypt block or just at the begin doe the phone at the other side discard those packet via a protocol whatsoev or tri it to turn them into voic output which would not be disturb at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two kei escrow agenc enter the vault agent 1 enter a secret random 80 bit valu s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enter a secret random 80 bit valu s2 these random valu serv as seed to gener unit kei for a sequenc of serial number thu the unit kei ar a function of 160 secret random bit where each agent know onli 80 second question why why is such a strang procedur us and not a real rng thi turn those s1 s2 in a kind of bottleneck for system secur when law enforc ha been author to tap an encrypt line thei will first take the warrant to the servic provid in order to get access to the commun line let us assum that the tap is in place and that thei have determin that the line is encrypt with the clipper chip the law enforc field is first decrypt with the famili kei f give e k u n document certifi that a tap ha been author for the parti associ with serial number n is then sent e g via secur fax to each of the kei escrow agent who return e g also via secur fax u1 and u2 u1 and u2 ar xore togeth to produc the unit kei u and e k u is decrypt to get the session kei k final the messag stream is decrypt all thi will be accomplish through a special black box decod so no technic provis will be taken to place a timeout on these warrant thi would be a uniqu possibl to realiz such a technic restrict by let the escrow agenc perform the decod of the session kei just take modem line instead of secur fax is thi such a bad idea a successor to the clipper chip call capston by the govern and myk 80 by mykotronx ha alreadi been develop it will includ the skipjack algorithm the digit signatur standard dss the secur hash algorithm sha a method of kei exchang a fast exponenti and a random a prototoyp will be avail for test on april 22 and the chip ar expect to be readi for deliveri in june or juli wow how doe the random work ar the sha and kei exchang secret or publicli known kei exchang is dh i guess it seem that those who ar oppos to thi chip shall have a tough time your govern reali mean to act friendli greet germano caronni instrument regist onli through thing thei re design to regist space still contain infinit unknown pgp kei id 341027 germano caronni caronni nessi cs id ethz ch fd560ccf586f3da747ea3c94dd01720f
