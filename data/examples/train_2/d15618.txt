about british cult member delet what exactli ar you try to sai and why were there no fire engin within a mile of the compound becaus the gun looni were fire on vehicl with 50mm amunit that ha a rang of 3000 meter thei were us 50 calib ammunit not 50mm ammo 50mm would be 5cm a shell of thi size would be larger than a lot of cannon shell sniper could have screen the peopl try to put out the fire besid the ranch hous not fort apocalyps it wa just a hous despit what the fbi and atf sai wa on fire the gun looni couldn t hardli have been shoot at fire men while there hous wa engulf in flame the fbi and atf don t have ani excus for not have fire engin there to put out the blaze the bastard wait until the fire wa well under wai befor thei call the fire depart in waco thei didn t even tell the fire depart to be on standbi i sincer hope that the fbi atf attornei gener janet reno and all other involv in thi fiasco get the just punish that thei so richli deserv someon should pai for thi needless tragic wast of human life sadli these evil sob will probabl never face justic the media and the govern will just whitewash thi incid and chalk it up as be sole david koresh s fault sadder still the american peopl will probabl believ them next question the problem is of cours the law that allow a bunch of rave nutter to collect a huge stack of arm in the first place thi is not the problem the problem is that we have a govern that is becom more tyrann everi dai if peopl decid to own gun and live in on place togeth then that is their prerog on the other hand if the bd were in posess of explos and illeg gun then the govern did have the right to search their compound but the alleg that the bd were in posess of illeg weapon hasn t been proven yet so i m not go to conclud that the bd broke ani law david koresh wa accus of abus children but if thi is hi onli crime then the presenc of the atf can t be justifi the atf is onli suppos to deal with firearm tobacco and alcohol violat atf agent ar basic cigarett cop thei should stai out of other kind of law enforc action that ar out of their jurisdict better yet thei should be s tcan imo the sequenc of event meant that there realli wa no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervent if the fbi had had the stomach for it thei could have mount a commando type raid and attempt to save the children by shoot all the adult sound like someth the ss would do human life children and adult alik should be treat with respect even if thei ar heavili arm religi wacko david koresh s lawyer seem to think that everyon would come out peacefulli sooner or later the fbi and atf had noth but time on their hand why did thei have to escal the situat and caus thi senseless tragedi their job is to protect the public and save live not kill peopl for cry out loud it realli wa a no win situat koresh had plenti of opportun to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf offic instead he order the murder of the children don t be so sure about that i read in a newspap todai that on of the cult member said that when on of the tank went through the wall that it knock over a lantern which caus the ranch hous to be caught on fire thi cult member also said that david koresh had no intent of commit mass suicid david koresh s lawyer also confirm thi therefor if thi is true then thi mean that the fbi and atf murder everyon in that hous even if thi is not true the fbi and atf still don t get off the hook becaus thei wait a damn long time to call the waco fire depart perhap thei want all these peopl to die in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessari to beleiv the word of a man who ha just murder 17 children and order the suicid murder of hi other 80 follow accord to the account given the batf attempt to serv a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfir in a deliber attempt to murder them the koresh gun support claim that the batf start shoot simpli doe not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shoot thei would have gone with heavier grade weaponri than standard issu handgun for all practic purpos thei were unarm the b d follow had automat weapon you re wrong on sever account atf agent were adequ arm thei had mp5s ar 15s and shotgun some agent were arm with automat pistol but not all were the atf s initi claim which thei later retract that agent were underarm is simpli ludicr the b d seig could not be allow to go on indefinit the b d were quit capabl of commit mass suicid and murder the children at ani time a commando assault wa the onli other like action that could have achiev that object that would have been veri riski order of magintud harder than antebb or the iranian embassi seig airplan and embassi ar not design for defens against attack ranch apocalyps wa 6 terrorist ar far easier to dislog without casualti than 80 allow the sieg to go on wa not an option either besid the seriou risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at ani moment there wa the question of the difficulti of keep the emmerg team on standbi over a prolong period the longer the sieg went on the more mental prepar koresh and hi follow would be for a prolong sieg rather than go in prematur the mistak wa probabl to go in too soon can you think of a better wai of get the children out a 100% certain wai the peopl who do not want gun control must obvious discount the entir govern stori thi is simpli rationalis it is not enough for them to simpli dismiss the govern as incompet that would requir them to come up with a solut themselv instead thei have to come up with a govern conspiraci theori wherebi the govern decid to set out to murder 80 peopl just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legisl through gun control isn t the onli issu here if the sick littl monkei in washington try to us the waco incid as a reason to ban gun then thei will have demonstr just how f ed up thei ar what concern me much more than new gun control legisl is that the govern seem to be abl to get awai with s t like thei did in waco thei ar becom more and more callou about peopl s right and the law thi greatli disturb me and it should disturb you as well thi conspiraci theori assum that the batf deliber got 4 of it agent kill and that the fbi etc actual enjoi sit out in the middl of texa be shot at by religi nutter still the conspiraci theori is comfort it allow them to pretend that waco prove noth except about how incompet the govern is in resolv a hostag crisi no govt in the world ha ever face a compar situat quit probabl there wa no manner in which it could be peacefulli resolv the blame doe not rest on the fbi it rest on the fact that koresh wa allow to get so far in particular the person who tip the b d off in advanc ha the murder of 4 atf agent and 17 children on hi or her conscienc there ar a larg number of peopl in the us who predict the end of societi preach salvat through arm secur the fact is that these ar the veri peopl who pose the threat to societi in the first place the next waco mai not be religi nutter but a polit movement a splinter group of the klu klux klan take over a schoolhous in a black area for exampl and hold sever hundr children hostag the onli possibl solut to such situat that can work is to prevent them aris no other govern in the world ha face such a situat thi is becaus no other govern ha so carelessli allow high power weaponri to becom avali to ani littl hitler or would be messiah to set themselv up as dictat in their own littl empir phill hallam baker scott kennedi
