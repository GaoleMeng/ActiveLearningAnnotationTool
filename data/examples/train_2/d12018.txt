acollin uclink berkelei edu andi collin write on not so quick question to throw out there for you gui for our class project we need to design and build a power suppli to the follow spec voltatg adjust from 1 12v current limit at 1a voltag must stai within 2% of design valu for i from 0 1a ac rippl less than 5 mv rm of cours we can t just us an adjust voltag current limit regul chip our problem is with the current limit i e we ve found stuff to do the rest of the part of the circuit what the suppli must do if present with a load which would draw more than 1a given the suppli voltag is reduc the voltag so that the current will equal on amp thu if we were to short the thing with the ammet we should read on amp if we measur the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12v we should read on amp and the output voltag by necess must be 1v the onli basic idea we have seen for the current limit involv a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefor reduc the output so doe anybodi have ani idea we could work from thank in advanc andi collin kc6yei acollin uclink berkelei edu ps if anybodi want to flame thi as a stupid project i agre fulli but i still have to do it it grade you can design for ramp shutoff brick wall current limit or even fold back cutoff sound like you want brick wall current limit your lead is correct to pull down the bia to the seri regul base drive in order to get the brick wall you need enough voltag gain on the current sensor normal a darlington on the current sens resistor will be adequ but for infinit gain us an op amp to sens the current rele to a stabl voltag refer and us a driver to turn off the base bia on the seri pass transistor phase compens mai be necessari with thi close loop control system if yopu have more than 180 degre phase shift in your feedabck circuit at uniti gain ok dino inqmind bison mb ca the inquir mind bb winnipeg manitoba 204 488 1607
