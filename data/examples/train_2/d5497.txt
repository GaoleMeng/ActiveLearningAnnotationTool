i m ask for help on a sticki problem involv unreason low appar precis in z buffer that i ve encount in 2 differ pex implement i can t find ani discuss of thi problem in ani resourc i can lai hand on e g the comp window x pex faq gaskin s _pexlib_program_manual_ vendor document i m post thi articl by itself on comp graphic and virtual the same articl with a test program demonstr the problem on comp window x pex the problem is hard to describ without pictur henc thi articl is longish if you can run pexlib 5 x program and ar interest i encourag you to build and run the test program in comp window x pex to see the effect yourself and plai with my approach to deal with it it depend on the util code from the abov gaskin book instruct for fetch it via anonym ftp ar given the problem to be solv is to elimin or minim stitch artifact result from the us of z buffer with polylin that ar coplanar with fill area the interpol z valu along a line will differ slightli due to roundoff error from the interpol z valu across an area even when the endpoint of the line ar coincid with vertic of the area becaus of thi it s a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixel or the area pixel to be displai visual the result tend to be a dash line effect even though the line is suppos to be solid us the pexlib api my approach to a solut is to us two slightli differ pex view map transform in two view tabl entri on for the area and on for the line the pex structur or immedi mode output must be organ so that on view tabl index is alwai in effect for area and the other is alwai in effect for line the result is a slight shift in npc z coordin for the line so as to attempt to bia the tossup situat in favor of the line thi shift is effect by move the front and back clip plane us in the pexlib view tabl entri for line just a hair backward i e smaller vrc z coordin compar to their posit in the view tabl entri us for area thi mean that when a point is transform to npc it z valu will be slightli bigger if it come from a line than if it come from an area thu accomplish the desir bia i would expect the z roundoff error which caus the problem to amount to a few unit at most out of the entir dynam rang of the z buffer typic from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 i e 16 or 24 bit z buffer therefor it seem that a tini fraction of the rang of z in vrc between the front and back clip plane ought to suffic to reliabl fix the stitch but in fact experi show that the shift ha to be as much as 0 003 to 0 006 of the rang empir it s worst when the npc z compon of the slope of the surfac is high i e when it appear more or less edg on to the viewer it s as if onli 8 or 9 bit of the z buffer have ani depend mean thi amount is so great that on problem is replac by anoth sometim the polylin show through area which thei ar suppos to lie behind i ve observ the problem on both hewlett packard and digit workstat pex server to approxim the same degre the test program demonstr the problem on an mit pexlib 5 x implement thi version is known to compil and run on an hp ux system with pex 5 1 open question 1 why doe thi happen am i configur the pex view tabl wrongli is there a systemat differ in z interpol for line as oppos to area e g pixel center versu corner which could be correct for ar pex implementor wantonli discard z precis in their interpol someth els 2 what to do about it can i fix my us of the view tabl to allow better precis in z buffer hlhsr is there anoth approach i can take to remov the stitch artifact am i just out of luck ani help would be immens appreci dave gorgen internet gorgen ann arbor applicon slb com applicon inc gorgen aaaca1 sinet slb com ann arbor michigan usa uucp uunet sharkei applga gorgen
