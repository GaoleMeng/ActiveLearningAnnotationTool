he becam reich chancellor in good part becaus he us bulli boi to attack communist hitler did not becom becom reich chancellor becaus peopl vote for him i m not sure if you meant to impli that or not but i just thought i d bring that up hitler becam chancellor becaus peopl vote for hi polit parti that s not a huge differ in a parliamentari system your statement is a common misconcept but it just isn t true in the german weimar system the chancellor wa not necessarili the leader of the largest reichstag parti the chancellor wa appoint by the presid and gener wa the leader of a coalit of parti who could form an effect major in the reichstag beyond that the implic that hitler rose to the chancellorship becaus a major of german want nazi rule is fals as well befor presid hindenburg appoint hitler chancellor in januari 1933 the german peopl did not show a particular desir to be led either by hitler or by the nazi parti these ar the result of the march 1932 elect for presid the closest hitler ever came to direct elect hindenburg 49 6% hitler 30 1% thaelmann 13 2% duesterberg 6 8% in the runoff elect in april the result were hindenburg 53% hitler 36 8% thaelmann 10 2% so we can see that hitler person wa support by onli about a third of german voter similarli the nazi parti never receiv more than 37% of the vote in reichstag elect that occur in juli 1932 in the novemb 1932 elect the nazi lost two million vote and 34 seat down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the reichstag comparit the socialist had 121 and the communist 100 the communist had gain 11 seat and the german nation parti which had support the previou govern had pick up a million of the nazi lost vote to gain 15 seat up to 52 i think the other larg parti wa the cathol center parti i don t know how mani seat thei had but i think thei were declin and there were numer other small parti thu the nazi vote wa on the declin at the time hitler wa appoint chancellor what brought hitler to power wa not the demand of the german peopl for hitler or the nazi to run thing but the inabl of the other parti to put their differ behind them in favor of form an effect govern for the countri germani did not have an endur democrat tradit and their parliamentari system lack effect center parti that favor the interest of the major of the popul instead what thei had wa a number of small parti who were unabl to put asid their own specif object in order to combin against the nazi who were out to end the democrat process in fact part of the problem wa that some of the other parti with substanti represent like the communist were also out to end the democrat process but with differ result in mind and gener didn t mind see parliamentari democraci go under germani had alreadi had a non nazi chancellor with a major coalit for five month while the nazi had been the largest reichstag parti and there certainli wa no danger of a revolut in favor of the nazi if anyth the nazi were start to get desper becaus thei had fail to get enough support to make hitler presid and their popular vote had begun to declin hitler wa not hindenburg s first choic to be chancellor not even hi second choic first von papen had been chancellor sinc june 1932 after the novemb elect when the nazi lost seat hindenburg first prevail on von papen to remain as chancellor but there were intrigu behind hi back and support for him wa lack so then hindenburg turn to von schleicher who becam chancellor for two month eventu he too wa unabl to hold togeth a work coalit of parti to oppos the nazi who refus to particip in ani govern that wa not led by a nazi chancellor some of the nazi leadership particularli gregor strasser who wa the 2 man in the parti at the time want to particip in a coalit govern but other know the parti s support wa wane figur that their best hope to gain power lai in undermin the democrat process nevertheless the countri wa govern for seven month by chancellor who were not nazi even though the nazi were the largest reichstag parti the failur of these men to achiev a work coalit wa due to the inabl of their coalit parti to work togeth here s how william shirer put it in _the rise and fall of the third reich_ the cardin error of the german who oppos nazism wa their failur to unit against it at the crest of their popular strength in juli 1932 the nation socialist had attain but 37 percent of the vote but the 63 percent of the german peopl who express their opposit to hitler were much too divid and shortsight to combin against a common danger which thei must have known would overwhelm them unless thei unit howev temporarili to stamp it out true the german peopl support hitler after he becam chancellor but that doesn t chang the fact that there wa not overwhelm support for him befor he wa in power the german peopl were not cry out for hitler to take over no matter how bad econom condit were the leftist parti socialist communist probabl had more support in total than the nazi hitler us the fact that other were passiv or activ will to see the govern paralyz as a mean to take it over eric smith eric netcom com eric infoserv com ci$ 70262 3610
