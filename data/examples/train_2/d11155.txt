what ar the typic size for kei for commerci secret kei algorithm i know de is 56 bit trippl de is 112 bit and idea is 128 bit is there anyth made in the us that ha 128 bit kei anyth anywher that ha larger kei i ve heard that rc2 can be scale to arbitrarili larg kei but is thi actual implement anywher final can anyon even conciev of a time place where 128 bit kei aren t suffici i certainli can t even at a trillion kei a second it would take about 10 billion year to search just on billionth of that kei space thank dane
