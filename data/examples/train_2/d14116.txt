book review the univers of motion by dewei b larson 1984 north pacif publish portland oregon 456 page index hardcov the univers of motion contain final solut to most all astrophys mysteri thi book is volum iii of a revis and enlarg edit of the structur of the physic univers 1959 volum i is noth but motion 1979 and volum ii is the basic properti of matter 1988 most book and journal articl on the subject of astrophys ar bristl with integr partial differenti and other fanci mathemat in thi book by contrast mathemat is conspicu by it absenc except for some rel simpl formula imbed in the text larson emphas concept and declar that mathemat agreement with a theori doe not guarante it conceptu valid dewei b larson wa a retir engin with a bachelor of scienc degre in engin scienc from oregon state univers he develop the theori describ in hi book while try to find a wai to mathemat calcul the properti of chemic compound base onli on the element thei contain the univers of motion describ the astrophys portion of larson s consist integr comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers a kind of grand unifi field theori that orthodox physicist and astro physicist claim to be look for it is built on two postul about the physic and mathemat natur of space and time 1 the physic univers is compos entir of on compon motion exist in three dimens in discret unit and with two reciproc aspect space and time 2 the physic univers conform to the relat of ordinari commut mathemat it primari magnitud ar absolut and it geometri is euclidean from these two postul larson wa abl to build a complet theoret univers from photon and subatom particl to the giant ellipt galaxi by combin the concept of inward and outward scalar motion with translat vibrat rotat and rotat vibrat motion at each step in the develop he wa abl to match part of hi theoret univers with correspond part in the real physic univers includ even thing not yet discov for exampl in hi 1959 book he first predict the exist of explod galaxi sever year befor astronom start find them thei ar a necessari consequ of hi comprehens theori and when quasar were discov he had a relat explan readi for those also as a result of hi theori which he call the reciproc system larson total reject mani of the sacr doctrin of orthodox physicist and astrophysicist includ black hole neutron star degener matter quantum wave mechan as appli to atom structur nuclear physic gener rel relativist mass increas relativist doppler shift nuclear fusion in star and the big bang all of which he consid to be noth more than mathemat fantasi he wa veri critic of the ad hoc assumpt uncertainti principl solut in principl no other wai declar etc us to maintain them the univers of motion is divid into 31 chapter it begin with a descript of how galaxi ar built from the gravit attract between globular star cluster which ar form from intergalact ga and dust cloud that accumul from the decai product of cosmic rai come in from the anti matter half of the physic univers galaxi format from the mythic big bang is a big mysteri to orthodox astronom he then goe on to describ life cycl of star and how binari and multipl star system and solar system result from type i supernova explos of singl star sever chapter ar devot to quasar which accord to larson ar dens pack cluster of star that have been eject from the central bulg of explod galaxi and ar actual travel faster than the speed of light although most of that speed is awai from us in time astronom and astrophysicist who run up against observ that contradict their theori would find larson s explan quit valuabl if consid with an open mind for exampl thei us to believ that gamma rai burst origin from pulsar which exist primarili in the plane or central bulg of our galaxi but the new gamma rai telescop in earth orbit observ that the burst come from all direct uniformli and do not correspond with ani visibl object except for a few case of direct coincid larson s explan is that the gamma rai burst origin from supernova explos in the anti matter half of the physic univers which larson call the cosmic sector becaus the anti matter univers exist in a reciproc relat to our materi univers with the speed of light as the boundari between them and ha three dimens of time and onli on dimens of space the burst can pop into our materi univers anywher seemingli at random larson heavili quot or paraphras statement from book journal articl and lead physicist and astronom in thi book 351 of them ar superscript with number identifi entri in the refer list at the end of the book for exampl a quot from the book astronomi the cosmic journei by william k hartmann sai our hope of understand all star would brighten if we could explain exactli how binari and multipl star form unfortun we cannot larson s book contain logic consist explan of such mysteri that ar worthi of seriou consider by all physicist astronom and astrophysicist for more inform answer to your question etc pleas consult my cite sourc larson s book un alter reproduct and dissemin of thi import book review is encourag robert e mcelwain b s physic and astronomi uw ec
