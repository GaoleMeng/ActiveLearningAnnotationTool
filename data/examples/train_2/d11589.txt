wellison kuhub cc ukan edu write i have a project that wa droop in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design what i am look for is a stabl ultra long solid state timer what thei want to do is to place thi thing on the antart ic shelf and measur the amount of snow fall over a period of six week everi two week thei want to trip a selonoid to discharg differ color pellet by ga pressur out across the snow then by dig down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measur as thei come to the differ color pellet the problem is try to build a timer that would stand the cold 40 degre and a power sourc that wouldn t drain i have look at the xr 2204 timer and the standard ne556 dual timer but thier temp spec won t go that low also two week equat to 1 209 600 second per fire which mean on big time cap i have found 2 2 farad ye farad cap that have a work voltag of 5 volt and ar small in size why ar you fool around with analog for thi job a singl chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliabl and easili an 8748 onli cost about $5 that and a $1 crystal and you re in busi emb the whole thing in a foam insul blanket power it from a solar cell us the excess power to heat the assembl dure the dai and reli on the insul to hold the heat dure dark if you don t want to try thermal manag contact someon like icl and have them cut you a special low temperatur crystal it ll cost at most $20 if you us a singl chip micro you re look at a part count of mayb 7 a processor a crystal two cap on the crystal a power fet to fire the solenoid a flyback diod and a batteri thi is fewer part than you can build an analog timer for and is infinit more reliabl add a power zener diod for heat and a solar cell and the part count scream up to 9 pd assembl ar avail for all the common singl chip micro thi applic is so trivial you could even look up the op code in the programm s guid and creat the binari with a hex editor john john de armond wd4oqc interest in high perform mobil perform engin magazin tm interest in high tech and comput marietta ga send ur snail mail address to jgd dixi com perform dixi com for a free sampl mag need usenet public access in atlanta write me for info on dixi com
