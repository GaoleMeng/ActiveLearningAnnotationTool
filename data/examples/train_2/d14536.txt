their differ or thei might be ostricis there were sever congreg howev whose leadership were recept to the new idea at least in part the tongu speak never realli caught on on of these wa the 14th street church of christ in gainesvil fl campu ministri had alreadi been regard as import at 14th street and the new idea seem to be veri help tool for evangel thei also seem to put vital into the church which mani felt had been lack in octob of 1967 the 14th street congreg hire chuck luca to be it campu minist by 1970 he would move to be the congreg s lead minist in the late 60 s earli 70 s the congreg work with mani other group thei held bibl discuss at daytona beach dure spring break thei organ talk in the fratern on the univers of florida campu thei also work with uf sport peopl in 1972 the congreg order a larger build to be construct when it wa finish the group move and chang it name now no longer appropri it becam the crossroad church of christ from then on a name that would becom legendari by thi time crossroad wa basic the onli cofc whose program were fulli align to the new movement while thei didn t start it thei continu it and were respons for where it wound up go by 1975 none of the other church of christ in the area felt that thei could cooper with crossroad due to what thei recogn as doctrin problem at crossroad crossroad had begun to heavili emphas and later requir attend at all church function it wa seen as a good thing for each member to have at least on close relationship a person with whom you would share all of your problem prai and get help from the concept wa call prayer partner which later becam discipleship partner and also later becam mandatori the leadership wa assign prayer partner to peopl for a while the book call the master plan of evangel wa a strong influenc on chuck luca he and the group believ that it wa everi person s duti and life purpos to carri out the great commiss crossroad wa grow in number and number becam veri import some would sai all import a person who wa evangelist wa spiritu evangel meant invit peopl to crossroad event if you did thi a lot and some of them convert then you were spiritu there were sermon about how if you bought groceri the cashier and bag boi ought to receiv invit to servic everyon at your job ought to receiv invit sinc these peopl need jesu you should be aggress don t take no for an answer if you did not evangel enough you came to be call lazi or unspiritu by the end of the decad the prayer partner system wa integr into a structur the elder and minist were on top like a big pyramid then the group leader bibl studi leader and member everyon who came in had someon place over them it is at thi time 1978 1980 that the bad press about crossroad began to circul the problem with rape on the univers of florida campu wa tremend but crossroad wa consid a bigger and more immedi problem there were mani complaint about the congreg and it pushi evangelist tactic crossroad wa consid the other church of christ to be dead church which aggrav them it wa aggress recruit out of the other church group denomin which aggrav them by thi time crossroad had grown numer to the point 1100 where not onli did thei believ that thei would soon need a new build but also thei were send out plant creat a new church and reconstruct reorgan an exist church team to other citi by thi time the crossroad movement wa underwai a group wa sent to the 30 member lexington church of christ in boston ma the team wa head up by kip mckean who had been convert out of a fratern by crossroad in gainesvil kip held a still stronger view of church author which he believ wa heavili vest in the evangelist s and not so much in the elder he had been fire in 1977 from the congreg that he had been work at when the elder there found numer thing wrong with hi theologi includ the practic of what came to be call on over on christian call thi by critic in the first year half of the 30 peopl felt that thei did not want to be a part of the new congreg thei left but other began come into the new boston church of christ ah but i m ahead of myself at crossroad the heavi hand system had begun to take it toll on the member mani have said that thei felt that thei were work hard but thei were not achiev the result that were so import the number were drop from 1978 crossroad membership declin steadili the leadership began to tighten the reign on the congreg who wa seen as be larg unproduct and unfruit the fruit passag in the nt were interpret as refer to new convert if you were not bear fruit said john 15 you would be cast into the fire boston still teach thi if you love your neighbor you ll save hi soul invit him to church and convert him if you re not do that you don t love your neighbor and if you don t love you re in danger of backslid the logic argument continu in thi vein in 1985 chuck luca wa fire from hi job as minist due to recur sin in hi life these struggl were never reveal to the congreg at larg although mani peopl outsid the congreg had heard about them for by now there wa veri littl contact on a friendship level between most crossroad member and those outsid if you have contact your focu should be on convert them bring them to a bibl studi chuck s replac wa joe wood who wa fulli support of the boston system as boston grew in number thei began to offer train session for other minist joe went to boston to be train and return to cross road readi to emphas the total commit to the church that boston and kip mckean were now emphas eventu in fall of 1987 the elder at crossroad now 2 in number dick whitehead and bill hogl made a decis boston wa demand that all of the other church in the movement come under the direct of the church in boston the elder refus cite their belief that each church should be autonom someth true in all non boston church of christ perhap there wa also some degre of offens done here sinc crossroad wa no longer the exampl to the rest of the movement the group now number about 800 while boston wa now larger in membership the church of christ gener teach that baptism is a necessari element of salvat at crossroad thei taught what wa call lordship baptism you had to understand the commit involv befor you could be baptiz you had to count the cost at boston thei took thi a step further if at some time you becam unproduct then your spiritu wa suspect peopl would begin to ask you if you realli understood what you were get into anyon who said no had their baptism deem invalid thei hadn t count the cost properli thei still had to be baptiz other call thi rebapt and crossroad didn t approv of thi practic when crossroad announc that it would not follow boston mani of it member left crossroad and went to movement relat ministri which were now call discipl ministri you were either discipl evangel or you were dead thei also us the nicknam movement of god for a while by summer of 1988 crossroad wa withdrawn from the movement and now stood alon thei had few to no alli in the mainstream church of christ and now none in the movement boston howev continu to chart it cours in the direct that thei had been follow thei sent reconstruct team to mani citi which usual meant that thei split the church there thei stop acknowledg other church of christ as christian and began to call themselv the remnant the remnant of the jew in the ot ar those who ar save by god it wa felt that the remnant todai repres all the christian sometim thei would simpli call their movement the church thei usual took the name of the citi for their name impli to the other church of christ that boston did not recogn their exist mani campus have now formal forbidden boston ministri from recruit there due to the number of complaint
