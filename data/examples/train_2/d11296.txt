o k if you ve read thi group for a while you know all about the on time pad but here s a question i haven t seen the on time pad yeild ideal secur but ha a well known flaw in authent suppos you us a random bit stream as the pad and exclus or as the encrypt oper if an adversari know the plaintext of a messag he can chang it into ani other messag here s how it work alic is send bob a plaintext p under a kei stream s alic comput the ciphertext c s xor p and send it to bob ev know the plainext p but want the messag to appear as p ev intercept c and comput c c xor p xor p s xor p ev send c to bob bob decrypt c by comput c xor s p thu receiv the fals messag which wa substitut by ev now the question is how can thi attack be defeat with inform theoret secur not just comput secur can we defin someth like ideal authent which is the analog of ideal secur can we obtain ideal authent if not how much can we limit ev s control over the messag if we can achiev ideal authent doe the solut us more kei bit or expand the messag can we show the solut to be optim in on or more paramet doe anyon know if these question have been aswer befor olson umbc edu
