robert g carpent rgc3679 bcstec ca boe com wrote i m wonder if it s possibl to us radio wave to measur the distanc between a transmitt s and receiv seem to me that you should be abl to measur the signal strength and determin distanc thi would be for short distanc 2000 ft and i would need to have accuraci of 6 inch or so you might try look at what avail in laser locat system thei work best for close work 1 mile and under rf is us for much longer distanc in two major mode transpond and phase measur transpond requir you send a puls to anoth station and it return it to you and you measur the round trip time minu the receiv time phase measur requir two or more transmit station send the same frequenc signal multiplex in time a receiv can pick them up and measur the phase shift between signal map can be drawn that plot the line of posit that correspond to a certain phase shift between two station john eaton hp vcd john
