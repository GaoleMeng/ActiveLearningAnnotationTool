archiv name ripem faq last updat sun 7 mar 93 21 00 00 0500 about thi post thi is a still rather rough list of like question and inform about ripem a program for public kei mail encrypt it thi faq not ripem wa written and will be maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu it will be post to a varieti of newsgroup on a monthli basi follow up discuss specif to ripem is redirect to the group alt secur ripem thi month i have reformat thi post in an attempt to compli with the standard for hypertext faq format to allow easi manipul of thi document over the world wide web let me know what you think disclaim noth in thi faq should be consid legal advic or anyth other than on person s opinion if you want real legal advic talk to a real lawyer question and answer 1 what is ripem ripem is a program which perform privaci enhanc mail pem us the cryptograph techniqu of rsa and de it allow your electron mail to have the properti of authent i e who sent it can be confirm and privaci i e nobodi can read it except the intend recipi ripem wa written primarili by mark riordan mrr scss3 cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routin which ar a librari call rsaref licens from rsa data secur inc 2 how can i get ripem ripem contain the librari of cryptograph routin rsaref which is consid munit and thu is export restrict from distribut to peopl who ar not citizen or perman resid of the u s or canada therefor the follow request is quot from the readm file pleas do not export the cryptograph code in thi distribut outsid of the usa or canada thi is a person request from me the author of ripem and a condit of your us of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain and a licens for it is includ with the distribut you should read it befor us ripem the best wai to get it is to ask a friend for a copi sinc thi will reduc the load on those site that do carri it not to mention the human that run them natur thi requir that you trust the friend ripem is avail via anonym ftp to citizen and perman resid in the u s from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readm file for info last i look thi site contain onli the sourc tree and doe not contain compil binari or the nice mac version ripem as well as some other crypt stuff ha it home site on rpub cl msu edu which is open to non anonym ftp for user in the u s and canada who ar citizen or perman resid to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file get_access for conveni binari for mani architectur ar avail here in addit to the full sourc tree 3 will ripem run on my machin probabl it ha alreadi been port to ms do and most flavor of unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port to macintosh includ a standard unix style port and a rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau author of stuffit more port ar expect and help of user is invit 4 will ripem work with my mailer probabl how easi and clean the effect interfac is will depend on the sophist and modular of the mailer though the user guid includ with the distribut discuss wai to us ripem with mani popular mailer includ berkelei mush elm and mh code is also includ in elisp to allow easi us of ripem insid gnu emac if you make a new interfac for ripem or creat an improv on on in the distribut which you believ is conveni to us secur and mai be us to other feel free to post it to alt secur ripem 5 what is rsa rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetr or public kei thi mean that there ar two differ relat kei on to encrypt and on to decrypt becaus on cannot reason be deriv from the other you mai publish your encrypt or public kei wide and keep your decrypt or privat kei to yourself anyon can us your public kei to encrypt a messag but onli you hold the privat kei need to decrypt it note that the messag sent with rsa is normal just the de kei to the real messag see what is de note that the abov onli provid for privaci for authent the fingerprint of the messag see what is a fingerprint like md5 is encrypt with the sender s privat kei the recipi can us the sender s public kei to decrypt it and confirm that the messag must have come from the sender rsa wa name for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invent it to find out more about rsa ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq or look in sci crypt 6 what is de de is the data encrypt standard a wide us symmetr or secret kei crypto system unlik rsa de us the same kei to encrypt and decrypt messag howev de is much faster than rsa ripem us both de and rsa it gener a random kei and encrypt your mail with de us that kei it then encrypt that kei with the recipi s public rsa kei and includ the result in the letter allow the recipi to recov the de kei de is sometim consid weak becaus it is somewhat old and us a kei length consid too short by modern standard howev it should be reason safe against an oppon smaller than a larg corpor or govern agenc it is not unlik that futur ripem will strengthen the symmetr cipher possibl by us multipl encrypt with de 7 what is pem and how doe ripem relat pem is privaci enhanc mail a system for allow easi transfer of encrypt electron mail it is describ in rfc 1421 1424 these document have been approv and obsolet the old rfc 1113 1115 ripem is not realli a complet implement of pem becaus pem specifi certif for authent kei which ripem doe not handl at thi time their addit is plan 8 what s thi about distribut and authent kei for a remot user to be abl to send secur mail to you she must know your public kei for you to be abl to confirm that the messag receiv came from her you must know her public kei it is import that thi inform be accur if a bad gui convinc her that hi kei is in fact your she will send messag which he can read ripem allow for three method of kei manag a central server the distribut finger server and a flat file all three ar describ in the ripem user guid which is part of the distribut none of them provid perfect secur 9 why do all ripem public kei look veri similar ripem public kei begin with a pkc identifi describ variou characterist about the kei so the first bunch of charact in your kei mai be the same as those of lot of other peopl s kei thi doe not mean your kei ar similar but onli that thei ar the same class of kei were gener with the same program ar of the same length etc 10 what is a fingerprint like md5 md5 is a messag digest algorithm produc by rsa data secur inc it provid a 128 bit fingerprint or cryptograph secur hash of the plaintext it is cryptograph secur becaus it is not possibl in a reason amount of comput to produc a differ plaintext which produc the same fingerprint thu instead of sign the entir messag with the sender s privat kei onli the md5 of the messag need to be sign for authent md5 is sometim us for other purpos for exampl it is often us to map an input of arbitrari length to 128 bit of data as a passphras interpret or cooki gener md5 is describ in it entireti includ an implement in c in rfc 1321 11 what is pgp pgp is anoth cryptograph mail program call pretti good privaci pgp ha been around longer than ripem and work somewhat differ pgp is not compat with ripem in ani wai though pgp doe also us rsa some major differ between pgp and ripem pgp ha more kei manag featur particularli for user without a direct network connect ripem conform to the pem rfc and thu ha a greater probabl of work with other pem softwar pgp make no attempt to be compat with anyth other than pgp in fact pgp 1 0 is not compat with pgp 2 0 ripem us rsaref a librari of rsa routin from rsa data secur inc rsaref come with a licens which allow noncommerci us pgp us it own implement of rsa which is not licens thu pkp the firm hold the u s patent on the rsa algorithm claim that it is a infring of that patent to make us or sell pgp in the u s or canada in acknowledg of thi pgp s origin author phil zimmermann sai in the document in fact if you live in the usa and you ar not a feder agenc you shouldn t actual run pgp on your comput becaus public kei partner want to forbid you from run my softwar pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem ar export restrict and cannot be sent outsid the u s and canada howev pgp alreadi exist on mani ftp site in europ and other place whether you us pgp or ripem or whatev the document to pgp is recommend read to anyon interest in such issu note that the abov fact both regard patent and export restrict ar somewhat controversi mani peopl think it shouldn t be that wai and some peopl interpret variou document differ unfortun discuss of it on the net inevit seem to produc more heat than light and probabl belong in misc legal comput see disclaim 12 what about rpem rpem stand for rabin privaci enhanc mail it wa similar to ripem but us a public kei cipher invent by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa it wa written by mark riordan the same author as ripem it distribut wa halt when contrari to the belief of mani includ rabin public kei partner pkp claim that their patent wa broad enough to cover ani public kei cipher whose strength rest in the difficulti of factor product of larg prime not just rsa thi claim is not univers accept by ani mean but wa not challeng for pragmat reason rpem is not realli us anymor it is not compat with ripem or pgp 13 what is mime mime stand for multipurpos internet mail extens and is describ in rfc 1341 you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime how pem should interact with mime is not yet entir clear some peopl us the stopgap solut of have a mime type applic x ripem in order to send ripem messag as mime on i hope some standard will emerg draft internet document exist on the matter 14 i have thi simpl wai to defeat the secur of ripem you mai wish to check the companion post ripem attack which discuss some of the more obviou attack on ripem s secur and what procedur will minim the risk ripem s main weak area is probabl kei distribut
