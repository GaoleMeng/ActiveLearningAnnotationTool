question 1 after claim that all atheist fit into neat psycholog pattern that you propos then semi retract that claim by state that you weren t refer to all atheist i ask you to name some atheist who you feel don t fit your pattern to show that you inde were not refer to all atheist that you ar awar of you fail to do so pleas do so now question can you name ani a a poster who do not fit into your stereotyp here is the context for the question thi is not true for everyon on thi board and you ar out of line in assum that it is you howev delet the text further along where i said that i didn t mean to impli that everybodi s experi wa along the same line whether or not you mean to make such implic you do so repeatedli allow me to approach the issu from anoth viewpoint can you name those atheist that you ve come across who do not fit into the pattern that you theoriz 2 you have taken umbrag to statement to the effect that sens and reason ar all we have to go by and when press you have impli that we have an altern call revel i have repeatedli ask you to explain what revel is and how on can both experi and interpret revel without do so via our sens and reason you fail to do so pleas do so now question can you explain what is revel and how on can experi and interpret it without us sens and inher reason here is the context for the question revel is not reason and if we do have revel then reason is not all we have first show me that revel exist second if revel is not perceiv through the sens how exactli is it perceiv accord to my webster s revel is an act of reveal or commun divin truth now tell me how such a thing can be reveal commun other than via the sens tell me how you can interpret thi revel other than with reason that is us your brain to interpret what you ar sens when i sai there is no wai for a human be to interfac with the univers other than via the sens as interpret by reason your brain it is becaus thi is the simpl truth if you have anoth mechan of interfac by all mean share it with us then later you cannot escap the fact that our entir interfac with the univers is our sens and our reason period again thi is indefens no it is simpl truth i challeng you to show me otherwis then later few mystic will agre to thi assert and the common defens of redefin sens to absorb for instanc mystic experi is beg the question of whether some sens ar better than other i allow you the broadest definit of sens to make thing easier for you now show me that mystic experi exist rememb you aren t allow to go by testimoni of other e g mystic sinc you have dismiss my testimoni as unreli you know taint by my own bia further onc these mystic thingi ar absorb show me evid that a human can recogn and respond to them short of interpret via that person s reason capabl i challeng you to show me these thing if you cannot do so you might as well give up the fight then later let me reiter you have not explain your interpret of your experi so it is not possibl for me to have attack them in point of fact i specif challeng you to explain thi revel stuff that you were talk about and i note for the record that you appear to have declin my challeng what is it how is it sens how is it interpret and how doe thi sens and interpret occur without the conduit of our sens and reason abil you have answer none of these question that go straight to the heart of your claim if you can t answer them your claim ar entir speciou 3 you have state that all claim to dispassion analysi made by a a poster ar unverifi and fantast i ask you to identifi on such claim that i have made you have fail to do so pleas do so now question have i made ani claim at all that ar unverifi and fantast if so pleas repeat them here is the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensit and intellig if wrong post then later likewis the refer to unverifi fantast claim repres fairli accur my reaction to all of the claim to dispassion analysi that ar repeat in thi group give me your address and i ll be pleas to send you a dictionari fail that can you name on claim that i have made that is in ani sens unverifi or fantast i demand that you retract thi statement if you cannot offer up evid if you follow your usual pattern of ignor the challeng then you ar simpli an asshol 4 first you dismiss claim by atheist that thei becam atheist as a result of reason then later you state that if on accept the axiom of reason that on couldn t help but becom atheist i ask you to explain the contradict your onli respons wa a statement that the question wa incoher an opinion not share by other that i have ask be thei atheist or theist you have fail to answer the question pleas do so now question do you retract your claim that a a poster have not becom atheist as a result of reason despit their testimoni to that effect if you don t retract that claim do you retract the subsequ claim that accept of the axiom of reason inevit result in atheism here is
