brian ceccarelli present us with the fallaci of fals dichotomi in state that we must accept everi thing in the book attribut to peter or we must discount everi other book of antiqu 1 peter di two millenia ago the origin letter he wrote have long sinc decai into dust if he were aliv todai and i could do you question the exist of alexand the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephu cyru the great artexerx their document have decai to dust too brian why anoth excus mr ceccarelli you seem to be state that we must accept accept everyth written in everi histor document somehow i doubt do that yourself that thu sinc i doubt you accept everyth written in everi histor document i would ask how you can therebi object justifi complet faith in the word of the book attribut to peter i shall now give an exampl of a document from antiqu which i am sure you reject it date from the time of rams ii thi wa first present here by matthew wiener these inscript were carv soon after a battl and were carv with the pharoah s specif approv so we have true origin rather than mere copi thi account record the the battl of kadesh circa 1285 bc which occur on the river oront about 100 mile south of aleppo the egyptian won thi battl with the hittit and rams had hi victori inscrib all over the place a few of of these inscript have surviv in near perfect form it is a record of how the pharoah pretti much singl handedli defeat the hittit after be separ from hi troop note that the egyptian waver back and forth between first and third person the follow is from miriam lichtheim s _ancient egyptian literatur_ volum ii my majesti caus the forc of the foe from hitti to fall on their face on upon the other as crocodil fall into the water of the oront i wa after them like a griffin i attack all the countri i alon for my infantri and my chariotri had desert me not on of them stood look back as i live as ra love me as my father atum favor me everyth that my majesti ha told i did it in truth in the presenc of my infantri and my chariotri note thi paragraph record not onli rams divin word but also that there were thousand of wit to the event now from the heart of battl then hi majesti drove at a gallop and charg the forc of the foe from hitti be alon by himself none other with him hi majesti proceed to look about him and found 2500 chariot ring him on hi wai out no offic wa with me no chariot no soldier of the armi no shield bearer my infantri my chariotri yield befor them not on of them stood firm to fight with them hi majesti spoke what is thi father amun is it right for a father to ignor hi son ar my deed a matter for you to ignor do i not walk and stand at your word i have not neglect an order you gave too great is he the great lord of egypt to allow alien to step on hi path what ar these asiat to you o amun the wretch ignor of god have i not made for you mani great monument i call to you my father amun i am among a host of stranger all countri ar arrai against me i am alon there s none with me the labor of mani peopl ar noth amun is more help than thei i came here by the command of your mouth o amun i have not transgress your command now though i prai in a distant land my voic resound in southern thebe i found amun came when i call to him he gave me hi hand and i rejoic he call from behind as if near by forward i am with you i your father my hand is with you i prevail over a hundr thousand men i am lord of victori lover of valor i found my heart stout my breast in joi all i did succeed i wa like mont i slaughter among them at my will not on look behind him not on turn around whoever fell down did not rise on call out to the other sai no man is he who is among us it is seth great of strength baal in person not deed of man ar these hi do thei ar of on who is uniqu who fight a hundr thousand without soldier and chariot come quick flee befor him to seek life and breath air for he who attempt to get close to him hi hand all hi limb grow limp on cannot hold either bow or spear when on see him come race along my majesti hunt them like a griffin i slaughter among them unceasingli so you see brian we have a few origin manuscript record the miracul battl between the rams and the hittit do you reject them as be complet true i suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own word question the exist of alexand the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephu cyru the great artexerx do you also therebi question all their document that s the problem with your all or noth approach mani ancient peopl us to mix a bit of fanci with their fact so for you to sai that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no record of antiqu at all forc you therebi to accept the veriti of document you probabl do not find complet credibl as to your other argument that so mani peopl have testifi to jesu that he must be true ar you go to just pass off all thi testimoni as fictious ar you go to call three thousand year worth of testimoni from shepherd to ir agent to royal offici to king to comput programm fiction with a scoff of your keyboard with near complet ignor of the testimoni ar you go to sai that that is all complet hooei would that not be the most audaci displai of arrog do you actual think you know better than king solomon king david or even abraham lincoln i have three point first thi is argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion you cannot vote on truth for instanc do the million of hindu s past and present who testifi to the realiti of brahma constitut actual evid for the exist of brahma how would you answer your own question in regard to the testimoni of hindu with a scoff of your keyboard with near complet ignor of the testimoni ar you go to sai that that is all complet hooei if you do so scoff then how do you object justifi your own special plead second it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testifi to jesu you can claim it to be clear but that doe not make it true third it is quit arguabl that abraham lincoln wa not christian and that he had both a public and a privat view of christian in fact there wa much discuss about it in hi dai ye he wa public accus of be a deist oh my i am present collect a faq for lincoln as i ve previous done for tyre jefferson and etc later dave butler my earlier view of the unsound of the christian scheme of salvat and the human origin of the scriptur have becom clearer and stronger with advanc year and i see no reason for think i shall ever chang them abraham lincoln to judg j s wakefield after the death of willi lincoln
