here is a revis version of my summari which correct some error and provid some addit inform and explan the clipper chip a technic summari dorothi den revis april 21 1993 introduct on april 16 the presid announc a new initi that will bring togeth the feder govern and industri in a voluntari program to provid secur commun while meet the legitim need of law enforc at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encrypt chip call the clipper chip togeth with a split kei approach to escrow kei two escrow agenc ar us and the kei part from both ar need to reconstruct a kei chip content the clipper chip contain a classifi singl kei 64 bit block encrypt algorithm call skipjack the algorithm us 80 bit kei compar with 56 for the de and ha 32 round of scrambl compar with 16 for the de it support all 4 de mode of oper the algorithm take 32 clock tick and in electron codebook ecb mode run at 12 mbit per second each chip includ the follow compon the skipjack encrypt algorithm f an 80 bit famili kei that is common to all chip n a 30 bit serial number thi length is subject to chang u an 80 bit secret kei that unlock all messag encrypt with the chip the chip ar program by mykotronx inc which call them the myk 78 the silicon is suppli by vlsi technolog inc thei ar implement in 1 micron technolog and will initi sell for about $30 each in quantiti of 10 000 or more the price should drop as the technolog is shrunk to 8 micron encrypt with the chip to see how the chip is us imagin that it is embed in the at t telephon secur devic as it will be suppos i call someon and we both have such a devic after push a button to start a secur convers my secur devic will negoti an 80 bit session kei k with the devic at the other end thi kei negoti take place without the clipper chip in gener ani method of kei exchang can be us such as the diffi hellman public kei distribut method onc the session kei k is establish the clipper chip is us to encrypt the convers or messag stream m digit voic the telephon secur devic feed k and m into the chip to produc two valu e m k the encrypt messag stream and e e k u n f a law enforc field which ar transmit over the telephon line the law enforc field thu contain the session kei k encrypt under the unit kei u concaten with the serial number n all encrypt under the famili kei f the law enforc field is decrypt by law enforc after an author wiretap ha been instal the ciphertext e m k is decrypt by the receiv s devic us the session kei d e m k k m chip program and escrow all clipper chip ar program insid a scif secur compart inform facil which is essenti a vault the scif contain a laptop comput and equip to program the chip about 300 chip ar program dure a singl session the scif is locat at mykotronx at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two kei escrow agenc enter the vault agent 1 enter a secret random 80 bit valu s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enter a secret random 80 bit valu s2 these random valu serv as seed to gener unit kei for a sequenc of serial number thu the unit kei ar a function of 160 secret random bit where each agent know onli 80 to gener the unit kei for a serial number n the 30 bit valu n is first pad with a fix 34 bit block to produc a 64 bit block n1 s1 and s2 ar then us as kei to tripl encrypt n1 produc a 64 bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarli n is pad with two other 34 bit block to produc n2 and n3 and two addit 64 bit block r2 and r3 ar comput r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 ar then concaten togeth give 192 bit the first 80 bit ar assign to u1 and the second 80 bit to u2 the rest ar discard the unit kei u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 ar the kei part that ar separ escrow with the two escrow agenc as a sequenc of valu for u1 u2 and u ar gener thei ar written onto three separ floppi disk the first disk contain a file for each serial number that contain the correspond kei part u1 the second disk is similar but contain the u2 valu the third disk contain the unit kei u agent 1 take the first disk and agent 2 take the second disk thu each agent walk awai know an 80 bit seed and the 80 bit kei part howev the agent doe not know the other 80 bit us to gener the kei or the other 80 bit kei part the third disk is us to program the chip after the chip ar program all inform is discard from the vault and the agent leav the laptop mai be destroi for addit assur that no inform is left behind the protocol mai be chang slightli so that four peopl ar in the room instead of two the first two would provid the seed s1 and s2 and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agenc the escrow agenc have as yet to be determin but thei will not be the nsa cia fbi or ani other law enforc agenc on or both mai be independ from the govern law enforc us when law enforc ha been author to tap an encrypt line thei will first take the warrant to the servic provid in order to get access to the commun line let us assum that the tap is in place and that thei have determin that the line is encrypt with the clipper chip the law enforc field is first decrypt with the famili kei f give e k u n document certifi that a tap ha been author for the parti associ with serial number n is then sent e g via secur fax to each of the kei escrow agent who return e g also via secur fax u1 and u2 u1 and u2 ar xore togeth to produc the unit kei u and e k u is decrypt to get the session kei k final the messag stream is decrypt all thi will be accomplish through a special black box decod capston the next gener a successor to the clipper chip call capston by the govern and myk 80 by mykotronx ha alreadi been develop it will includ the skipjack algorithm the digit signatur standard dss the secur hash algorithm sha a method of kei exchang a fast exponenti and a random a prototoyp will be avail for test on april 22 and the chip ar expect to be readi for deliveri in june or juli acknowledg and distribut notic thi articl is base on inform provid by nsa nist fbi and mykotronx permiss to distribut thi document is grant
