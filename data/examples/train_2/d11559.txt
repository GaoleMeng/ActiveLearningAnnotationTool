clipper csrc ncsl nist gov clipper chip announc write the presid todai announc a new initi that will bring the feder govern togeth with industri in a voluntari program to improv the secur and privaci of telephon commun while meet the legitim need of law enforc a nice formul for the introduct of the first encrypt devic with built in trapdoor just like the fed want for too long there ha been littl or no dialogu between our privat sector and the law enforc commun to resolv the tension between econom vital and the real challeng of protect american rather than us technolog to accommod the sometim compet interest of econom growth privaci and law enforc previou polici have pit govern against industri and the right of privaci against law enforc bla bla protect electron mail and comput file while encrypt technolog can help american protect busi secret and the unauthor releas of person inform it also can be us by terrorist drug dealer and other crimin inde and the current propos doe noth to prevent the latter an ordinari telephon it scrambl telephon commun us an encrypt algorithm that is more power than mani in commerci us todai thi doesn t sai much there ar mani incred weak encrypt algorithm in commerci us todai thi new technolog will help compani protect proprietari inform protect the privaci of person phone convers and prevent unauthor releas of data transmit electron except from the govern at the same time thi technolog preserv the abil of feder state and local law enforc agenc to intercept lawfulli the phone convers of crimin nope the crimin won t be stupid enough to us the new chip thei ll us someth secur thi technolog provid onli mean to intercept the phone convers of peopl who ar stupid enough to us it agenc to decod messag encod by the devic when the devic is manufactur the two kei will be deposit separ in two kei escrow data base that will be establish by the attornei gener access to these kei will be limit to govern offici with legal author to conduct a wiretap that is the govern ha the kei it doesn t matter much if thei ar in on or in two of it hand the clipper chip technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american correct it doe howev provid those american with the fals sens of privaci devic in addit respect expert from outsid the govern will be offer access to the confidenti detail of the algorithm to assess it capabl and publicli report their find if the screen is not public it cannot be trust some peopl do not trust de even todai after all the examin onli becaus some part of it design were kept secret the chip is an import step in address the problem of encrypt s dual edg sword encrypt help to protect the privaci of individu and industri but it also can shield crimin and terrorist we need the clipper chip and other approach that can both provid law abid citizen with access to the encrypt thei need and prevent crimin from us it to hide their illeg activ in order to assess technolog so thei ll us a differ technolog to hide their illeg activ so will those law abid citizen who do not trust their govern not to misus it abil to decrypt their convers the privaci of our citizen includ the need to emploi voic or data encrypt for busi purpos except from the govern the need of u s compani to manufactur and export high technolog product huh later it sai that the new technolog will be export restrict sinc encrypt technolog will plai an increasingli import role in that infrastructur the feder govern must act quickli to develop consist comprehens polici regard it us the administr is commit to polici that protect all american right to privaci while also protect them from those who break the law in short the new technolog can 1 protect the law abid citizen s privaci from the casual snooper it cannot 1 protect him from the govern if it decid to misus it abil to decrypt the convers 2 protect him from the crimin who succe to break the new encrypt scheme or to steal the kei or to bribe the peopl who handl them etc 3 prevent the crimin from us secur encrypt for commun q doe thi approach expand the author of govern agenc to listen in on phone convers a no clipper chip technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american correct howev it doe not provid them that much privaci as it claim q who will run the kei escrow data bank a the two kei escrow data bank will be run by two independ entiti at thi point the depart of justic and the administr have yet to determin which agenc will overse the kei escrow data bank two candid the nsa and the mafia q how strong is the secur in the devic how can i be sure how strong the secur is a thi system is more secur than mani other voic encrypt system readili avail todai that is trust us while the algorithm will remain classifi to protect the secur of the kei escrow secur through obscur system we ar will to invit an independ panel of cryptographi expert to evalu the algorithm to assur all potenti user that there ar no unrecogn vulner if it s not entir open to public examin it cannot be trust besid who can prove that the devic us for examin and the on built into your phone will be the same q whose decis wa it to propos thi product a the nation secur council the justic depart the the nsa and the fbi q who wa consult the congress industri a we have on go discuss with congress and industri on encrypt issu and expect those discuss to intensifi as we carri out our review of encrypt polici we have brief member of congress and industri leader on the decis relat to thi initi why did thei forget the academia q will the govern provid the hardwar to manufactur a the govern design and develop the kei access encrypt microcircuit but it is not provid the microcircuit to product manufactur product manufactur can acquir the microcircuit from the chip manufactur that produc them doesn t thi smell to monopol q who provid the clipper chip a mykotronx program it at their facil in torranc california and will sell the chip to encrypt devic manufactur the program function could be licens to other vendor in the futur like the mafia q if the administr were unabl to find a technolog solut like the on propos would the administr be will to us legal remedi to restrict access to more power encrypt devic thi is the main question why wa it buri at the end a thi is a fundament polici question which will be consid dure the broad polici review the kei escrow we ll see mechan will provid american with an encrypt product that is more secur more conveni and less expens than other readili avail todai but it is just on trust us the administr is not sai sinc encrypt threaten the public safeti and effect law enforc we will prohibit it outright as some countri have in short if we decid to outlaw strong crypto we ll tell you effect done nor is the u s sai that everi american as a matter of right is entitl to an unbreak commerci encrypt product there is a sinc the us govern seem to consid strong crypto as munit and sinc the us constitut guarante the right to everi american to bear arm why is not everi american entitl as a matter of right to an unbreak commerci encrypt product a it indic that we understand the import of encrypt technolog in telecommun and comput and ar commit to work with industri and public interest group to find innov wai to protect american privaci help busi to compet and ensur that law enforc agenc have the tool thei need to fight crime and terror bullshit the propos technolog provid a fals sens of secur encrypt devic with built in capabl for break the encrypt doe not prevent the crimin to us strong crypto and is a step to outlaw strong crypto q will the devic be export will other devic that us the govern hardwar a voic encrypt devic ar subject to export control requir case by case review for each export is requir to ensur appropri us of these devic the who wa the optimist who believ that the new administr will leav the export control on strong crypto devic ok i m not american it s not my busi but i just couldn t resist to comment the whole plot look so totalitarist it s up to you american to fight for your right regard vesselin p s now is the time for david sternlight to pop up and claim that the new system is great vesselin vladimirov bontchev viru test center univers of hamburg tel 49
