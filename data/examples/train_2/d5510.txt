think he is either a poor golfer or a bad carpent but there ar veri veri few peopl who will think he is a good and clever programm if you chose to call yourself by a term that mean thief don t be surpris when peopl think you ar a thief even if you don t agre with that definit of the word the narrow view that a hacker when associ with the comput environ is a dishonest expert is not so widespread i m my opinion at least with the peopl involv with the field imho the wider mean is not obsolet at all no matter how much the lai press would like it to be therefor i conclud that if you call yourself a hacker and somebodi perceiv you as a thief then thi person belong to a veri veri small group that ha some comput knowledg but not enough to know the wider and origin mean of the word unfortun the gener public ha a veri narrow view of the deep dark recess of the art of comput what littl thei do see is from the view given to them by the media from what i have seen from the media
