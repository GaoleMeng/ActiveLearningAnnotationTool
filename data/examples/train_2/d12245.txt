i m look for a circuit that will flash an led on in respons to the output from a walkman cassett player how could i do thi i don t want it just to turn on i want it to strobe onc so to speak per everi beep i put on a cassett tape would it be better to us a circuit base on the volum of the beep on the cassett or better for the led to respond to a tone of a certain frequenc is there ani easi wai to do either of these i m look for the simplest circuit possibl i guess what i m ask for is some sort of color organ but not quit let me trt to explain again i m go to have a pattern of beat or beep on a cassett tape so on the tape you d hear beep paus beep paus beep paus etc with speed increas as time goe on i want to synchron an led probabl two of them with the beep on the cassett tape so the led with each beep would go on and off real quick gener a strobe light sort of effect the rapid of the beep on the tape would in turn effect the rapid of the blink of the led and if there wa no sound on the tape except for background hi the led would remain off pleas help thank dana
