well it realli isn t thi cut and dry but as a jai fan the thing i fear worst ha happen the yank sent down william g and ar go to start william b in cf i also believ thei kept wickman and millitello in their rotat which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought thei d throw out their to the slaughterhous becaus of their experi grant witt might be good but i think that thei us rational to keep the youngster up and not given the job to witt becaus he wa a good pitcher and ha experi the yank ar show that thei ar take posit stride forward the jai with the loss of dave stewart ar look at gigant hole in their pitch staff the oriol should also be there in the end gord niguma to salvag the season let jj olerud win mvp
