hi i ve just built a valv preamp and us a diod capacitor voltag multipli to step the 12vac suppli voltag up to approx 260vdv as the load resist increas the rc constant decreas and henc the output voltag drop i need as high an output voltag as possibl about 260v the circuit consist of seven voltag multipli stage ie 14 diod and 14 capacitor each capacitor develop about 38v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitor 260v each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v if i increas each of the capacitor rate 220 470mfd that will increas the rc constant and henc allevi some of the problem these capacitor ar go to be a littl expens as i need 14 of them so 1 what would happen if i connect a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output and henc in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitor will it as i assum increas the c in circuit and henc increas the rc time constant if it doe and my output voltag becom more stabl by do thi then i will have kill two bird with on stone as i am experienc some 50hz rippl and henc amp hum and thi new capacitor will smooth thi out and 2 can anyon recomend a suitabl valu for an inductor choke to be place in the output line of the power suppli to filter out the 50hz main hum lowest resist possibl i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment becaus it is too much of a distract i m at univers and i ve got to get my dissert finish in two week henc i m mail not plai with my soldero iron it ll be cheaper too in the long run especi if 14 new larg capacitor don t work as plan email pleas can t alwai read the net thank in advanc chri name mr chri smith twang on that ol guitar addr scst83 uk ac liv csc uni liverpool univers quest to build more and more hardwar dgree comput scienc what ever the sun mai be it is certainli not a ball of flame ga d h lawrenc all view express ar my own and reflect that of privat thought
