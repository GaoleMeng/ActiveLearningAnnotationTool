suppos the fbi also prevent them from come out with their hand up while nation tv camera watch watch from where two mile awai far enough awai that whatev realli happen must be explain through the veng filter of a humili agenc that said quot enough is enough pleas tell me what you think would have happen had the peopl come out with their hand up sever week ago it didn t happen and who is respons for it not happen certainli not the children koresh wa call the shot he wa talk with hi lawyer and the fbi sinc other were releas safe there is no sane reason for keep the children insid the compound the fbi and koresh were call the shot and there were veri sane reason for keep the children if thei let them go the parent would never see them again that is not an easi choic in spite of you cold attitud about it scenario that is simplest and most plausibl i do not gener believ in conspiraci theori that involv complic and unlik scenario the fbi sent letter to martin luther king s wife insinu that mlk wa have an affair again pleas tell us exactli how much you trust our supposedli benevol govern more than someon who would not releas children from the compound obvious you ar an author worship not at all ar you a koresh worship i am a constitut worship you quit obvious eat anyth the author feed you without doubt which make you no differ that a koresh worship i e more than david koresh vernon howel jesu christ i saw lengthi excerpt from an australian documentari made in 1992 that clearli show that thi wa a cult give me a camera and time with you and i can present excerpt that show you to be a cult leader guarente thank for my laugh of the dai definit a veri silli supposit if you do not believ thi you ar truli naiv it is not onli possibl it is easi i work in the broadcast profess at a network station in the late 70s i know what i m sai here embarras footag is easi to get add a littl sinist music and the right voic over and i ll have you mother agre to commit you you should at least view the whole documentari befor you claim it as a sourc i would if i could the new show that show the lengthi excerpt also had interview with the filmmak who made the documentari who basic confirm what wa shown in the excerpt from the time he spent at the compound in 1992 the new show were look for excerpt which back their posit do you think thei would show excerpt which disprov their point i am not pleas with the batf handl of the affair i think thei bungl it badli from the start but i don t think thei ar respons for the fire which start in two differ place two place eh you saw thi or did the wonder fbi tell you thi i saw on place i believ that thi wa report by local radio report on site a fire start in a three stori tower at the same time as the two stori window shown on the tv coverag the report of multi start came sole from the fbi anyon observ the fire from the avail video would be hard press to see more than on point of fire which spread across the compound as a uniform rate the batf is by no mean devoid of fault in the handl of thi affair but to suggest that thei mai have intention start the fire is ludicr i suspect that there were plenti of camerapeopl will to risk small arm fire to get some good footag these peopl were told to get the hell out of camera rang why couldn t answer thi on eh thi is the most import question of all it is the root caus of all the other suspicion i thought about mention how reagan and the militari treat the press in grenada and how that set the preced but decid it wasn t worthi of discuss if the new report got shot you can bet hi famili would sue the govern for let him into the danger area no report ha ever su the govern for such a situat thei know the danger rememb the batf invit the initi coverag and how about a simpl remot control camera or two there were wai to provid media access the fbi obvious just didn t want ani the root caus of suspicion in my mind is why 100 peopl wouldn t flee a build that had numer exit dure the 30 minut time it took to burn down or why didn t thei flee hour earlier when the tear ga wa first introduc i can find no ration explan for their behavior i can find sever tear ga and smoke make it imposs to remov the barricad flame block exit to the saferoom perhap the gun shot were from the fbi keep them pin in who know jim jmd handheld com i m alwai rethink that there s never been a dai when i haven t rethought that but i can t do that by myself bill clinton 6 april 93 if i were an american as i am an englishman while a foreign troop wa land in my countri i never would lai down
