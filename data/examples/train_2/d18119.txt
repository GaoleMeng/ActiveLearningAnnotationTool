in articl c51qr5 duu encor com rcollin encor com roger collin write juli eddi jpl nasa gov juli kanga write i suggest you listen veri carefulli to the stuff yeltsin and hi peopl ar sai and compar that with the veri anti west slogan come from hi oppon in the russian congress i sure know who i want to back could we back him without forc other to back him at the point of a gun if we had back him strongli earli on i doubt there would be the problem there is now mani russian becam disillus with democraci and reform when thei felt rightli imo that the west didn t care yeltsin wa virtual promis massiv aid onc bush got over hi gorbi mania thi probabl kept him from dismantl the congress and call for new elect well the aid didn t come through and we didn t make sure it went to the proper place and now the anti reform ar gain strength where befor thei were in hide have you consid a non interventionist polici if market reform doe happen russia will certainli get privat capit at privat risk to help their economi thei will even have incent to do so for the same reason if thei don t reform then our govern will probabl consid them enemi anywai and rather spend monei to hurt rather than help them if thei don t reform i don t believ in give them monei howev i think thi is too import to take a non interventionist approach thi is what realli bug me about libertarian it sound like it ll all be the same in a hundr year time no need to do anyth how doe thi affect us well we ar on the same planet and if vast track of europ ar blown awai i think we d feel someth a massiv breakup of a countri that span 1 6th the planet is bound to have affect here of cours there is also the humanitarian argument that democraci should help other democraci or struggl democraci if a $1 6 billion gift wa that import to our well be couldn t it be rais voluntarilli peopl alreadi give over $100 billion a year to chariti despit the wish of libertarian thi societi is a far wai and get farther from be libertarian perhap voluntari gift would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it we have to face the problem now not in x year when we have a libertarian dream societi right now there ar huge stumbl block to trade let alon chariti there ar still limit to high tech export nasa can t bui proton launch vehicl from them sure the market mai be abl to help a great deal but it can t right now there ar too mani obstacl instead of fight against the aid you should be fight to tear down the obstacl the market and chariti have to face serious everyon ha differ opinion on what is stupid my two caus ar aid to russia and a strong space program someon els will champion welfar or educ or do studi of drunken goldfish that is why we have a republ and not a true democraci instead of gridlock on a massiv scale we onli have gridlock on a congression scale it seem instead of gridlock on ani scale we have aid to russia expens space program nation chariti that doesn t help the poor and probabl studi of drunken goldfish i think limit govern is more kei than how democrat it is well i think limit govern is primarili democrat due to it be limit but the main question is how do you transform a state run economi and monolith govern into someth that even remot look like our btw sometim it seem that our govern is try to go the opposit direct it is not go to be painless and not go to be easi we simpli cannot wait to help when thei have the proper govern thei ll never get there without the aid it mai be too late alreadi btw who is to decid stupid thi is just like those who want to impos their moral on other just the sort of thing i thought libertarian were against that wa an opinion and libertarian ar veri big on free speech and i m just excercis mine actual my polit ar pretti libertarian except on thi on issu and thi is why it is imposs for me to join the parti it seem that libertarian want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you ar pretti libertarian except on thi on issu then you should be veri libertarian consid it a compromis how much monei would your fellow russia aider have to give to russia if those you oppos weren t us the same govern machin to steal monei from you and your group for caus you don t support as i also said abov anoth problem i have is with transform a libertarian societi is not go to happen painlessli or overnight i have seen noth about how to take our current govern and societi and turn it into a minim govern and a respons self suffici populac we could do that 100 year ago but not now peopl have been sai that for hundr of year thei didn t have nuclear weapon 100 year ago nor instantan commun nor travel to virtual anyplac on the earth in less than a dai like it or not we ar in the begin of a global economi and global decis make all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more effici process inform than to depend on ruler for decis on complex issu ye depend on the ruler of the free market and the busi ruler do emerg somewher and thei will never repres the opinion of everi person on the planet there must be check and balanc check on the govern when it get out of bound and check on industri when it get out of bound put all your hope on the benevol of the market is to me just like put all your hope on the benevol of govern juli disclaim all opinion here belong to my cat and no on els
