strnlght netcom com david sternlight write though some mai argu about the nose of the camel it s worth note that the govern propos is limit to scrambl telephoni if it is onli us for that purpos and doe not extend to electron mail or file as usual david sternlight is demonstr hi inabl to read the propos clearli state the initi will involv the creation of new product to acceler the develop and us of advanc and secur telecommun network and wireless commun link it speak about telecommun in gener read it again david mayb you ll understand it the next time nah probabl not encrypt then it is an improv over the current mass produc standard civilian technolog which with a few except is limit to easi to break invert that s exactli what the govern want all sheep mind peopl to think let s look at the current situat it allow to almost anybodi to eavesdrop almost everybodi unless secur and i mean secur encrypt is us what will happen when if ha optimist the new propos get accept almost nobodi except some will be abl to eavesdrop everybodi els but the abil of these some to eavesdrop will be guarante the propos emphas on the former almost nobodi which is clearli an improv and forget to mention the drawback of the latter guarante ye my statement assum that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlaw you think that it will not happen good luck note that the big issu for the fed is the continu abil to wiretap it s not just continu abil it s guarante abil befor we go off the deep end with long discus about secur crypto for e mail and file let s focu on thi yeah that s exactli what your govern want you to think let s take small step on at a time concentr on the current on don t think about the futur trust us on question that wa not ask in the releas is whether thi propos is limit to telephoni or if the govern intend to expand it it s not ask becaus the propos clearli sai that thi is the intent thei unlik you read what thei write though i share mani of the concern express by some i find the propos less threaten than mani other sinc right now most american have no secur telephoni and ani jerk with a pair of clip lead and a goat can eavesdrop thi would also plug up the secur hole in cellular and cordless phone ye it will it will stop the jerk who is eavesdrop now it will allow onli to the govern to eavesdrop if the scheme is secur of cours which is yet to be proven but how do you know that the jerk you ar fear now will not get a govern job tomorrow the new propos guarante him the abil to eavesdrop then hell that will even motiv him to get that job if he inde is that mental pervert read between the line i infer that the system is highli secur without access to the kei great the greatest cryptograph of all time david sternlight tm ha succeed to evalu the new system in the absens of ani detail whatsoev and ha conclud that it is highli secur i guess that come from the background of work some 50 year for the two major crypto evalu compani right gee now the govern can save all that monei and troubl to ask a secret council of crypto expert to secretli analys the new secret method for david sternlight ha alreadi done all the job for them thi would meet the need of u s busi confront by rich and power adversari includ french and japanes secur servic and rich japanes compani it allow the nsa to make avail some of it better stuff while protect law enforc need trust us we re from the govern and we re here to help you most legitim u s corpor trust the nsa and would be delight to have a high secur system certifi by them even at the price of deposit kei in escrow i see no difficulti in creat a reliabl those who ar prepar to trade their liberti for the promis of futur safeti do not deserv either thi or someth like that i don t have the exact quot but the mean is the same ha been said by on of your great men mayb you should studi their work more carefulli if you have the brain to understand them of cours from my point of view thi is a fair start point there ar concern that need to be address includ the reliabl of the escrow but in the main question is to guarante to avail of realli secur cryptographi to the mass gee if the propos wa sai we guarante that everi american will still have the full right to us ani kind of encrypt s he would like and regard thi propos as just a default voluntari implement there would have been much less opposit for some reason thei didn t even try to promis you that i wonder why wa orwel off onli by 10 year return we get access to high secur crypto no in return you get crypto that is guarante to be crippl mani have suggest that de and other system mai be breakabl by the nsa and henc other similarli skill and endow while the abov is just rumor and while even if it is true it is not done easili the new scheme can is guarante to be easili breakabl by anybodi who ha the two kei it might be also breakabl by somebodi who doe not have them but know the right trick or who ha onli on of them nsa also told you that de is secur why don t you simpli trust them huh there is at least a good possibl which should be check that the propos system is not so breakabl it doesn t have to it is guarante to be easili breakabl just get the kei it might be even easier but until there is some evid thi is just a wild specul be nor doe it have to have trapdoor if the govern can get the kei the trapdoor ar there in govern s hand the kei pursuant to a legitim court order thu thei can protect legitim commun against econom adversari while still be abl to eavesdrop on crook pursuant to a court order legitim and who decid what commun ar legitim oh i guess it s the govern right the gui who alreadi have the kei it s kinda if i have the kei from your car and i am ask to decid who ha the right to us it legitim in discuss thi let s try to avoid the nasti person attack and nois of some previou thread imposs sinc you ar demonstr the same level of incompet and ignor as in the proviou thread thi is a substant and technic issu and person remark have no place in such a discuss unfortun i have yet to see you post a technic compet messag regard vesselin vesselin vladimirov bontchev viru test
