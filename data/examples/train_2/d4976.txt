ok with all the discuss about observ playback speed with quicktim the effect of scale and so on i thought i d do some more test first of all i felt that my origin speed test wa perhap less than realist the movi i had been us onli had 18 frame in it it wa a version of the veri first movi i creat with the compact video compressor i decid someth a littl longer would give closer to real world result for better or for wors i pull out a copi of 2001 a space odyssei that i had record off tv a while back about fifteen minut into the movi there s a sequenc where the earth shuttl is approach the space station specif i digit a portion of about 30 second durat zoom in on the rotat space station i figur thi would give a reason amount of movement between frame to increas the differ between frame i digit it at onli 5 frame per second to give a total of 171 frame i captur the raw footag at a resolut of 384 288 pixel with the spigot card in my centri 650 quarter size resolut from a pal sourc i then import it into premier and put it through the compact video compressor keep the 5 fp frame rate i creat two version of the movi on scale to 320 240 resolut the other at 160 120 resolut i us the default 2 00 qualiti set in premier 2 0 1 and specifi a kei frame everi ten frame i then ran the 320 240 movi through the same raw speed test program i us for the result i d been report earlier result a playback rate of over 45 frame per second that s right i wa get a much higher result than with that first short test movi just for fun i copi the 320 240 movi to my extern hard disk a quantum lp105s and ran it from there thi time the playback rate wa onli about 35 frame per second obvious the 230mb intern hard disk also a quantum is a signific contributor to the speed of playback i modifi my speed test program to allow the specif of option scale factor and tri plai back the 160 120 movi scale to 320 240 size thi time the playback speed wa over 60 fp clearli the poster who observ poor perform on scale playback wa see quicktim 1 0 in action not 1 5 i d try my test with quicktim 1 0 but i don t think it s entir compat with my centri and system 7 1 unscal the playback rate for the 160 120 movi wa over 100 fp the other thing i tri wa save version of the 320 240 movi with prefer playback rate greater than 1 0 and see how well thei plai from within movieplay ie with quicktim s normal synchron playback a prefer rate of 9 0 45 fp didn t work too well the playback wa veri jerki compar thi with the raw speed test which achiev 45 fp with eas i can t believ that quicktim s synchron code would add thi much overhead i think the slowdown wa come from the mac system s task switch a prefer rate of 7 0 35 fp seem to work fine i couldn t see ani evid of stutter at 8 0 40 fp i think i could see slight stutter but with four kei frame everi second it wa hard to tell i guess i could try recreat the movi with a longer interv between the kei frame to make the stutter more notic of cours thi will also improv the compress slightli which should speed up the playback perform even more lawrenc d oliveiro fone 64 7 856 2889 comput servic dept fax 64 7 838 4066 univers of waikato electr mail ldo waikato ac nz hamilton new zealand 37 47 26 s 175 19 7 e gmt 12 00
