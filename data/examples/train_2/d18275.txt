same as quot the order taken out of context word can be interpret much differ than had on appli them within the confin of their origin express i think thi is the case regard hymenaeu beta frater superior of the order to which i belong when he includ that bit from merlinu x he did us all a servic he show us the extrem to which order member have been known to go in their fervor i have littl knowledg regard reuss background but sure he wa an unusu man and he wa an import forc in the order for mani year yet as peopl chang so do order chang and while we look back so carefulli at the dirti laundri of o t o rememb that thi is onli the surfac skim and that mani perspect ar now encompass which extend beyond ani on individu i hope to show that there wa and is much room for a differ of opinion within the order itself perhap by test the limit myself let us examin thi issu a bit more close in 1895 karl kellner 1850 1905 a wealthi austrian industrialist and paper chemist as well as a high grade mason found the ordo templi orienti kellner had travel wide in the east where he met three adept who instruct him specif magic practic kellner s effort to develop the order were later assist by franz hartmann heinrich klein and theodor reuss who had work togeth prior to join the o t o the order wa first proclaim in 1902 in reuss s mason public oriflamm on kellner s death reuss succeed him as outer head o h o the jubile edit of the oriflamm publish in 1912 announc that the order taught secret of sexual magic theodor reuss wa an interest charact born june 28 1855 in augsburg he enter masonri in 1876 he wa a singer journalist and possibl a spy for the prussian polit polic infiltr the socialist leagu found by karl marx s daughter and her husband reuss wa later associ with william wynn westcott a leader of the golden dawn who later introduc him to john yarker yarker charter reuss to found the rite of memphi and mizraim in germani after sever attempt to concret variou mason rite reuss settl on the develop of the o t o the order experienc reason steadi growth under reuss leadership for exampl he charter papu in franc rudolph steiner in berlin and h spencer lewi in the usa in 1912 the histor meet between reuss and crowlei occur crowlei wrote that reuss came to him and accus him of reveal order secret when crowlei look at it afresh the initi interpret of sexual magick unfold itself to him for the first time reuss appoint crowlei as suprem and holi king of all the english speak world and it wa thi author that he invok when publish the materi of the equinox reuss resign as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffer a stroke and name crowlei hi successor all wa well until 1925 when _the book of the law_ wa translat into german there wa a break in the continu of the order manyk member split with the new o h o over the book which crowlei wa activ promulg through the order he had earlier revis dthe order ritual at reuss s request deepli infus the doctrin of the new aeon revel _an introduct to the histori of the o t o _ by ad veritatem ix within _equinox iii 10_ edit by hymenaeu beta frater superior rex summu sanctissimu caliph of the unit state of america publish by samuel weiser 1990 there ar mani possibl reason that our frater superior includ thi materi in _equinox iii 10_ and thi is the real point is it not why did he wish to publish such thing about the histori of hi own organ doe he repres a dogmat threat to the principl of thelema or is he exercis hi true will and put forth veri complex pictur with no easi answer a pictur which leav room for veri mani interpret it is quit easi for me to see for exampl that all of o t o deriv out of the dribbl of falter masonri purchas by clever huckster with an ounc of courag and some write abil to aid them and i can take that all the wai down to our present caliph whose feebl support of the law of thelema is laughabl at best would i be thrown out of the order for speak in thi wai will i i think not why becaus my frater will see it as a perspect an interject i am us as an exampl my illustr show that we mai express thing in the context of a larger work and the true signific of thi mai be quit difficult to apprehend at first so it mai be with oto and merlinu x pleas look o t o more carefulli i do not support reuss s word myself as i am not qualifi to assess them and i am critic of their pompos if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allow to continu do so then what can thi sai about the health of the order doe it mean that the order ha gone soft and abandon it moral principl or doe it mean that it is strong in it abil to let the will of univers kinship aris on it own not shackl by some dogmat requir how shall we resolv these two possibl i find a high calibr of individu associ with ordo templi orienti thei ar often quit intellig and sometim veri well vers in arcan or usual inform thei ar quit often artist and genius have met some 20 longstand member in the sf bai area mani who ar or were veri heavili involv with the order i can vouch for the integr of the organ as it stand i have sometim question the polici of hymenaeu beta in these moment i follow my intuit and i ve found littl to stop me from request a second initi from a differ o t o bodi i m happili particip in social group feast or initi and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tast thi doesn t make me an author on order polit and explan howev i can onli hypothes and relai to you what i understand base on my limit contact with other member i urg you not to take the word of merlinu x too far there ar mani wai to interpret word and mani peopl who have becom involv with the order feel veri strongli about the sanctiti of person freedom and the preserv of individu vision i welcom other comment on thi issu and will be write more in respons to other post in thi thread invok me under my star love is the law love under will i am i frater i
