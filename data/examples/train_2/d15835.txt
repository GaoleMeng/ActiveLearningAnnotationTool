have read the post long articl by jpfo i have some observ 1 thi articl doe not claim that the gca of 1968 is a verbatim translat of a nazi law what it sai is that in anoth place the book thei re talk about thei compar the two thing section by section the implic is that the similar ar devast in the next sentenc thei talk about how in that book thei reproduc the german text of the nazi law togeth with it translat not surprisingli a reader could easili conflat these two thing into a singl idea that the american gca is a liter translat of the nazi law and sure enough that s what the whole thing ha mutat into urban folklor style 2 the articl goe to great pain to establish that senat dodd had a copi of the nazi law either from hi time on the nurnberg prosecut team or later thi fact is consid highli incrimin but i don t understand why the author repeat sever time that he is simpli unabl to imagin how anyon could come into possess of the origin text and yet in a paragraph toward the end he explain it perfectli if dodd got hi copi of the origin german text of the nazi weapon law dure hi time at nurnberg it like wa part of a collect of document for exampl issu of the reichsgesetzblatt the german law registri bingo exactli dodd had a book with a seri of nazi law in it includ the on under discuss all of the stuff about why would a u s congressman have a copi of a nazi law melt awai by the author s admiss he then continu but if he acquir the origin german text of the nazi weapon law after hi servic at nurnberg he must have done so for a veri specif reason but there s absolut no reason to think that thi is the case in fact as a senior member of the u s team that help to prosecut nazi war crimin it seem to me that he would have had to have a copi all argument about whether the nazi weapon law is realli of histor interest as it obvious is certainli accord to the author here or whether dodd person prosecut the interior minist who sign it can be put asid as red her 3 have establish that dodd own a copi of the origin german text the jpfo articl then tri to draw sinist implic from the fact that he ask to have it translat the problem is in the context of the charg level at dodd these two thing work against each other peopl ask to have thing translat when thei don t know what thei mean if dodd took it upon himself to preserv the nazi law with idea of somedai introduc it into american law sure by 1968 he would have know what it meant wouldn t he anywai thi precis charg the main on that i question in an earlier post is just silli why would dodd need the exact translat for thi purpos is the idea that the gun control despit be presum bent on disarm the populac with the goal of eventu destroi all civil liberti need a crib sheet didn t thei have ani idea how to do it on their own onc again the author provid a perfectli accept answer to hi own question dodd mai have offer hi copi of the nazi weapon law to show that the specif propos did not resembl anyth in the nazi law in fact sinc the law and it translat were enter into the congression record under the head of document concern the histori of nazism and gun confisc dodd s motiv isn t a mysteri he ask for the translat in order to put it in the cr 4 even thi articl make it clear that the part of the nazi law that wa ad by the nazi regim is onli a small part of that law registr of gun for instanc wa begun in 1928 and thu not a nazi inspir idea the part of the nazi law that parallel the 1968 gca includ handgun control of some sort and the identif of certain weapon as sport weapon the jpfo then goe on to list other part of the nazi law forbid ownership of weapon by jew of cours there ar no such provis in the american gca nevertheless in a rhetor move guarante to muddi the water immedi after the discuss of the anti jewish part of the law the jpfo articl continu given the parallel between the nazi weapon law and the gca 68 so as to get maximum emot mileag out of that aspect of the law don porg porg inmet camb inmet com uunet inmet porg
