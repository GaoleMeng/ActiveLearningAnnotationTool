present your opinion as oppos to mine i would hardli take them as fact becaus you don t agre with them hmm no becaus a fact and an opinion ar two differ thing what you ar express here ar opinion not fact in the abstract what you re sai is true but the fact happen to agre with me and disagre complet with you i could give you hundr of word in my mother tongu spanish that ar comonli us and you will never find in a dictionari even more i could show you a lot of mean that word in spanish have differ from those in the dictionari we re talk about the latter not the former and what you re talk about is slang in the latter that clearli ha never been the case here no i am not talk about slang i am talk about differ us of the same languag in differ place listen pinka i m go to count on the supposit that you think through the opinion you have someth which is by the wai against my better judgment base on what i ve seen from you to date we ar agre aren t we that dictionari ar refer book for the usag of a given languag and in particular for the mean of the word and phrase which compris that languag now you ar us mean complet differ from inde in some case diametr differ from those given in the dictionari as a refer book a dictionari contain those mean in both past and as much as it can in current us that s also why thei ar updat so often now if you ar sai thing which you give differ mean than the dictionari doe and us non standard mean about everi word what is your chanc of be taken at face valu just about none just about no on will take you that wai becaus the word mean someth differ to them it s quit clear to me from the respons thi thread ha been get that that is exactli what is happen ponder that and guess why isn t it curiou that we do not know how mani peopl defin in how mani differ wai the term jew which is the basi of the movement itself no probabl becaus the question hasn t been ask gee i hate it when peopl draw conclus without inform don t you i hate peopl who cannot read i did not draw ani conclus i just said that it is curiou consid how heterogen the movement is what you did wa ask a lead question in english idiom the phrase and guess why in the wai you us it is a load question with onli on answer expect i also take offens at be told i cannot read by someon who is obvious have troubl with the subject himself mr pinka i am a phd candid in my field on doe not get to phd candidaci if on cannot read the law of return and jewish nation is defin in term of religion and not of cultur ident even if 80% of those defin as jew in isreal ar not religi for the umpteenth time it is not defin in term of religion thi ha been proven to you over and over again no it ha not the law of return defin a jew as someon who ha a jewish mother and ha not convert to anoth religion that is pretti the same as the religi definit that is a problem i am sai that i do not support zionism as it is now i believ that among the peopl in the soviet communist parti some might even had been inspir by nobl ideal doe that chang the final result of what happen in the ussr ar you now wish to compar the ussr and israel or what israel doe not practic cruelti now i understand you ar unabl to make abstract you cannot get the idea from a text and you take everyth liter bad thing balderdash you know thi is fals i would be abl to make the abstract if it bore ani resembl to the fact of the matter your did not the analog is utterli inapplic i wouldn t be in the field i m in astrophys if i couldn t make abstract and specul about the gener grand scheme of thing i also wouldn t be in educ which i am and my student give me rather good review i d add if i couldn t draw such analog about israel not practic cruelti ask those palestinian in isra prison those who were tortur those whose hous had been blown by the armi the vast major of palestinian in isra prison aren t tortur and their hous weren t blown up by the armi in fact you ve seen me protest such measur on thi net befor ar you now try to intim my agreement with them i never said it directli nor indirectli i am not talk about individu who defin themselv as zionist here i am sure most of them ar good honest and care peopl i am talk about the result of the zionist movement in other word you ar take that as a monolith and ignor the dissens within it disagr that is express freeli and is wide base just as bad can you read or ar you just type at random do you know the mean of the word you us or do you expect the reader to read your mind i can read just fine thank you and i don t need someon who is obvious have some troubl with a tongu which isn t hi nativ on tell me how to read the word in my own nativ tongu if it were spanish i d ask you i am talk about a movement whose action result in a law of return with a religi definit of jew a countri that defin nation base on religion then you re not talk about the movement as it exist todai as i ve been try to tell you pleas read the argument i ve given you if you can still sai thi after read them you need to read them again i am talk about someth i consid a form of racism such as differenci base on religi belief after all if arab in israel cannot serv in the armi is becasu thei were not born in the right religion arab in israel not onli can but do serv in the idf as you well know thei can serv it is true but thei ar not allow to do the all the same thing as the isra citizen who happen to be jew ye thei ar as you well know ok fine now we know what you re talk about but do you see my point about how your word could easili have been taken differ it is not we it wa you as in the second person in singular who cannot understand a text if thing ar not explicitli said balderdash see abov onc again you have a lot of gall and absolut no right to lectur a nativ speaker of a languag who is well educ in it in a languag which isn t your own nativ tongu and with which you re obvious have problem so there is no differ between citizenship and nation in israel or what do you mean by actual it doesn t i mean exactli that arab and jewish citizen of israel have the same right if there is no differ between them why keep them in id s better yet ar you go to tell me that there ar no differ in social life between arab and jew social life is on thing legal statu is anoth onc again thi is a lead question so it follow a religi definit and not a cultur on that is what i call a form of racism no becaus the jewish religion and cultur ar intim insepar intertwin if on renounc judaism on renounc judaism i do not believ that thi is true final question is it possibl to be both jewish and muslim jewish and christian your respons will be enlighten how sad to see a model of decorum and tranquil becom like ani other sport a battleground for rival ideolog to slug it out with glee tim rice chess eric s perlman
