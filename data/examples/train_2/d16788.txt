in articl 1483500368 igc apc org center for polici research cpr igc apc org write % %by elia davidsson april 1991 revis oct 1991 note you ar alreadi post fact some of which ar outdat the bias present of fact as well as the conclus that you reach leav me littl hope of engag in ani fruit exchang that might lead to a meet of the mind it is to those who read with open mind that i address myself %the intern convent on the elimin of all form of %racial discrimin adopt by the gener assembl of the %unit nation in 1965 ha now been ratifi by most member %state articl 1 of thi convent defin the term racial %discrimin as ani distinct exclus restrict or %prefer base on race colour descent or nation or ethnic %origin which ha the purpos or effect of nullifi or impair %the recognit enjoy or exercis on an equal foot of %human right and fundament freedom in the polit econom %social cultur or ani other field of public life while the ideal embodi in thi text ar worthi goal as the text current stand i know of no countri in which racial discrimin of some sort can not be found it make no mention of the need for for a legisl violat %the gener assembl endors in 1975 a resolut defin %zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimin the %import correct and legitim resolut is incomplet sinc %it doe not includ oper statement design to end isra %racial discrimin meanwhil the unit state on behalf of %israel ar exert heavi pressur on member state of the unit %nation to repeal thi resolut and give isra racial %practic zionism moral legitimaci if you ar in principl advoc un intervent via oper statement in thi case it must therefor hold that thei can be appli to ani other case where the council perceiv some form of racial discrimin as previous exhibit scarei thought %the veri definit of israel as a state belong to the jew of %the world but not to it inhabit alien all nativ %non jew born in that countri actual i know quit a few nativ non jew born in israel that ar not alien by thi law if you had said some you would probabl be correct howev your tendenc to exager and slant fact becom appar thi slant permeat the text %practic all non jew who ar live in or origin from area %under isra control identifi themselv as palestinian most %of them ar muslim mani ar christian a few jew includ the %author of these line also identifi themselv as palestinian the abov statement is not true practic all discount beduin circassian druze and some other fring group your own identif is a matter that ha no bear upon the issu you could equal identifi yourself as a insert group %zionism took off in europ at the end of last centuri it s aim %wa to creat a jewish state in palestin in spite of the adam %opposit of palestinian arab 95% of the popul if i recal correctli at the time zionism took off there wa no adam opposit in palestin i am open to ani factual contradictori evid %but the %zionist were more power militarili econom and %technolog and succeed in 1948 in conquer 70% of the %area of mandatori palestin after drive into exil most nativ %arab from the conquer area approxim 750 000 peopl and %raze most of their villag to the ground the zionist could %final establish a predominantli jewish state onli 150 000 %non jew remain on isra territori do you therefor contend that the 400 villag you mention further on most of their villag %onc the jewish state wa establish it began enact law to %help the confisc of land from nativ non jew their %polit repress and their destitut there is no doubt that law pass provid a framework which wa later us for these purpos howev you seem to impli that thi wa the intent a priori which impli a polici and agenda my knowledg wa that thi wa not the case you also neglect to mention the circumst that surround thi as you do again below %in 1967 the state of israel invad egypt and syria and occupi %the rest of palestin the west bank and the gaza strip thu %anoth 1 5 million palestinian fell under it juridict it %occup of palestinian and other arab territori is consid %illeg by the intern commun as reflect in secur %council resolut israel ha reject all u n resolut and %began without delai to entrench it occup and rule over these %territori with the aim of annex them at the appropri time not quit accur israel ha not reject all the resolut though it ha conflict understand with regard to some of them israel never annex the sinai west bank or gaza the other annex were brought about partli due to the un resolut %part of these territor east jerusalem and the golan height %have alreadi been forcefulli annex by israel in defianc of %intern law and un resolut out of curious provid that the annexe ar grant citizenship what int l law do you claim prohibit annex of territori captur in war ha thi ever been appli to ani other countri previous other than iraq %it must be emphas that although these peopl live under %differ regim thei ar unit in their self percept as %palestinian that is as peopl identifi with palestin a %territori entiti not an ethnic or religi entiti incorrect palestinian themselv claim to be discrimin against on an ethnic or racial basi therefor your abov statement is incorrect i also note that given the previou definit of racial discrimin the onli mean that you could argu for that is nationalist howev no such nation ha exist it definit did not exist at the time of the creation of israel in which case you can not argu racial discrimin dure that period %furthermor palestinian gener consid the plo both as a %symbol of nation ident and as the unchalleng author that %repres them in world affair onc again some do some don t %the non jewish popul live in the palestinian and other arab %territori occupi by israel in 1967 suffer not onli blatant %discrimin but is subject to brutal militari occup anoth gener but then again you don t seem to care about anyon other than the palestinian peopl whose caus you espous %licenc to start a busi and to bui industri equip the %right to educ children all of these basic right ar subject %to arbitrari rule by militari author and cannot be %challeng in court incorrect onc again thei have the abil to appeal furthermor although you mai not agre with them not all of the militari rule ar senseless or arbitrari some ar but thi is not due to the whim of the militari as much as the sizeof the task organ %onli jewish inhabit of the occupi %territori ar permit to carri firearm incorrect onc again i know two arab policemen who live in daheisha and there were more of cours with the outbreak of the intifada thei were forc by the local to resign bitterli %jewish settler have %right to 6 7 more water per person than non jew jewish resid %of these territori number now about 100 000 peopl it is israel %governmentu polici to increas thi number substanti in %total defianc of intern law un resolut and the will %of the popul the state of israel systemat confisc %land from non jewish inhabit of these territori for jewish %settlement that is no longer true and i can t help but wonder what your purpos is wa in post thi %some 800 000 peopl in israel proper ar not jew most of them %consid themselv palestinian with isra citizenship for %mani year after the establish of israel thei were subject %to harsh militari control much of their land wa confisc by %the state and hand to jewish organis for exclus jewish %settlement thei have been subject to massacr destitut and %humili while thei enjoi with jewish isra the right to %vote thei ar discrimin against both through law and in %practic onc again to hell with the other minor that don t fit in right their ar mani villag who did not suffer in the wai you seem to indic abu gosh come to mind ye some did but as a result of what action %approxim 92% of the surfac of the state of israel within the %rgreen line is for all purpos close to palestinian who ar %second class citizen in israel thei mai neither legal live on %such land nor rent or cultiv it a direct effect of these %polici is that nativ non jewish citizen of israel ar deni %resid and membership right in most rural commun in %israel includ the collect settlement kibbutzim non jew %ar discrimin against in mani other wai the govern %starv local author of palestinian villag and township of %fund jewish citi council forc palestinian to live in ghetto %jewish famili receiv higher child alloc than their %non jewish neighbor palestinian school suffer underfund and %understaf as compar to jewish school palestinian %children ar deni the right to learn their histori and %literatur isra who struggl for equal right and for the end %of racial discrimin suffer continu harass by the %author 1 there ar some kibbutzim with arab non jewish member it is up to the member of the kibbutz there is no legisl against it nor against a pure non jewish collect 2 fund ar the result of polit lobbi bear in mind that non_jew compos 20% of the vote popul it ha never fail to amaz me that thei fail to form on larg bloc and increas their power the recent elect ar a case in point 3 pleas provid factual evid support your alleg with regard to educ materi you have obvious never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank it is base upon jordan s school system 4 with regard to your last statement it is simpli anoth gross gener %the state of israel refus to acknowledg itself as the state of %all it inhabit although the isra cabinet ha never %openli endors the transfer idea the forc remov from the %countri of it nativ palestinian popul that is it %ultim judaiz isra govern polici toward %non jew bear the mark of thi final solut no attempt is %made by the zionist author to integr palestinian arab %into isra public life thu although compris approxim %17% of the popul of isra citizen no palestinian citizen %of israel ha ever serv as cabinet member as director of %ministri or of a nation institut as judg of the suprem %court as ambassador of israel or in ani lead posit in %isra econom or financi life even the director of the %ministri for arab affair ye such a thing exist is a jew anoth gener but let not stop here the transfer idea wa espous by on parti in the last gov t moledet it wa intend to be a solut to the problem in the territori not the countri itself with regard to other item i recal at least on arab ambassador and the rest wa cover previous %although sexual %relat between and cohabit of jew and non jew ar legal %thei ar consid by isra zionist societi somewhat a betray %of the jewish and zionist ethic the isra educ system %nurtur thi attitud in a systemat wai when wa the last time you were in israel that is simpli not true nor ha it been for quit some time the question of religi intervent is best answer by the proport represent and the lack of ani arab parti bloc to counter the orthodox on %zionism reject the idea of a modern secular state base on %equal of all citizen thi is on main reason why israel ha %not produc ani written constitut simpli incorrect the answer is polit onc again your failur to understand the dynam and movement insid isra gov t releg your content to the sidelin %zionism predic a state %where jew have privileg right thu accord to isra law %a jew born in london who ha never visit israel doe not speak %hebrew and profess atheism is grant automat isra %citizenship while nativ palestinian inhabit who happen to be %christian or muslim ar treat almost as alien racial %discrimin as defin in intern law is thu not onli %reflect in isra law and polici but is ground in the %veri natur of israel as a jewish state but the discrimin is not base upon race oop sorri nasti habit i have of counter malici fals truth %ani propos for isra arab and isra palestinian peac that %doe not address the issu of racial discrimin by israel %that is the zionist natur of the state of israel is thu doom %to fail real world intrus ani propos that doe is doom to fail of cours i wouldn t expect you to understand wrap up as you ar in your view of thing let s not let anyth
