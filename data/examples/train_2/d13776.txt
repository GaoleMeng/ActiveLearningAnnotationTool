ssf is up for redesign again let s do it right thi time let s step back and consid the function we want 1 micrograv vacuum process research 2 life scienc research adapt to space 3 spacecraft mainten the old nasa approach explifi by shuttl and ssf so far wa to central function these project fail to meet their target by a wide margin the militari and commerci user took most of their payload off shuttl after wast much effort to tie their payload to it and ssf ha crumbl into disorgan and miscommun over $50 billion ha been spent on these two project with no reduct in launch cost and littel improv in commerci space industri meanwhil militari and commerci user have come up with a superior strategi for space develop the constel firstli differ function ar broken down into differ constel place in the optim orbit for each function thu we have the gp navstar constel in 12 hour orbit comsat in clark and molniya orbit etc secondli the task is distribut amongst sever spacecraft in a constel provid for redund and full coverag where need ssf s 3 main function requir quit differ environ and ar also prime candid for constel 1 we have the make of a micrograv constel now comet and mir for long durat flight shuttl spacelab for short durat flight the best strategi for thi area is inexpens increment improv instal of u s facil on mir shuttl mir linkup and transit from shuttl spacelab to a much less expens ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet we might also expand the research program to take advantag of interest space environ eg the high radiat van allen belt or ga plasma gradient in comet tail the comet system can be much more easili retrofit for these task where a station is too larg to afford launch beyond leo 2 we need to studi life scienc not just in micrograv but also in lunar and martian graviti and in the radiat environ of deep space instead of the protect shelter of leo thi is a veri long term low prioriti project sinc astronaut will have littl practic us in the space program until cost come down order of magnitud furthermor us astronaut sever restrict the scope of the investig and the sampl size so i propos labratsat a constel tether bolo satellit that test out variou level of graviti in super van allen belt orbit that ar repres of the radiat environ encount on earth moon earth mar earth asteroid etc trip the miniatur life support machineri might be oper real time from earth thru a vr interfac after sever orbit mission have been flown follow on can act as ldef on the lunar and martian surfac test out the actual environ at low cost befor $billion ar spent on astronaut 3 by far the largest market for spacecraft servic is in clark orbit i propos a fleet of small teleoper robot and small test satellit on which ground engin can practic their skill onc in place robot can pry stuck solar arrai and antenna attach solar batteri power pack inject fuel etc onc the fleet is work it can be spun off to commerci compani s who can work with the comsat compani to develop comsat replac modul standard by appli the success constel strategi and get rid of the fail central strategi of st and old ssf we have radic improv the capabl of the program while greatli cut it cost for a fraction of ssf s pricetag we can fix satellit where the satellit ar we can studi life s adapt to a much larg more repres varieti of space environ and we can do micrograv and vacuum research inexpens and if need in special purpos orbit n b we can appli the constel strategi to space explor as well greatli cut it cost and increas it function mar network and artemi ar two good exampl of thi more ambiti we can set up a network of nativ propel plant on mar that can be us to fuel planet wide rover ballist hopper prospect and sampl return the descend of labratsat s technolog can be us as a mar surfac ldef and to test out close ecolog greenhous on mar at low cost nick szabo
