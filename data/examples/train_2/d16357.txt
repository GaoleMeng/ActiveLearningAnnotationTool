thi wa post by lyn bate to the firearm polit mail list i recent learn that don kate wa go to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situat of cours thi wa all set up after the incid start but long befor it unhappi conclus so yesterdai i went to hear him what follow is a rough summari of what i think i heard him sai which should not be taken as exactli what he actual said kate start by sai that sinc he didn t know ani more about the fire than the audienc did it had just happen the dai befor he would not discuss that but would concentr on the origin raid koresh definit wa not plai with a full deck but so what thi isn t the first time that the leader of a new small religi group ha been ridicul by the public extrem religi view nearli alwai fuel hatr and mistrust the first amend appli mayb especi to peopl like koresh lengthi digress into the histori of polic organ in the us there were none until about 1830 when thei began in metropolitan area polic origin were not arm if thei found a crime in progress thei call local arm citizen to help mani began to carri arm for protect despit regul against them eventu the law were chang to allow them to carri gun the origin intent wa to have mani small polic depart jealou of on anoth and competit but not larg enough to be a threat to liberti henc the plethora of organ rang from postal inspector to the coast guard when the fbi wa start agent did not have the author oto carri gun thei were to be after all a bureau of investig not a polic forc all polic agenc will be misus by anyon in power to maintain that power the batf start as a tax collect agenc whose primari job wa to raid illeg still when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshin no longer found their trade no longer profit mani illeg still disappear and the batf need someth els to do to justifi it exist so it turn to activ like phoni raid on gun store around the time when the batf s annual budget is under review the media is alert by the batf to come to such and such a place where at a pre arrang time a bunch of car full of batf agent roar up to the door and the media get great pictur of the agent enter the premis of a gun dealer suspect of not keep book properli the media isn t invit in for the bore hour of agent leaf through paperwork but if ani irregular ar found the media get to cover the agent remov arm of gun from the premis and the luckless ffl in chain the waco incid happen a few week befor batf s budget wa up for review kate opinion is that it wa a stage public stunt that went bad and that the batf never thought for a moment that thei would actual be shot at or thei would have plan the raid differ not send 100 agent over open ground with no cover for exampl and would have had some medic personnel on hand he confirm that some year ago there wa a warrant for koresh s arrest in connect with a murder charg and the local sheriff call him on the phone and explain about it koresh sai ok come pick me up and the sheriff did temporarili confisc all the gun so that thei could be test koresh wa later clear releas and presum got hi gun back at least at that time he wa ration enough to be approach ration and behav in a reason manner the batf didn t take into account that unlik most of the ffl s thei audit koresh wa actual paranoid and foster paranoia in hi follow thu the pubic stunt look like a real attack to them and thei react accordingli with respect to the origin warrant it had not been unseal when kate wa give hi talk so he could not comment on it except to mention that the batf ha been known to not doubl check the veractii of their inform if thei can manag to get a judg to issu a warrant he had more to sai about the wai the warrant wa serv which mai have been complet illeg appar the proper wai to serv a warrant is to knock on the door and announc that you re an offic with a warrant for thu and so if thei don t open the door and the evid is flushabl then it is ok to break in the door but sinc it is hard to flush gun down the toilet there mai have been no justif for the batf break in the wai thei did if the constitut right of the davidian were violat by an invalid warrant or by an improperli serv warrant then the davidian mai have been justifi in their acton a close look at on of the origin film show that on batf agent _mai_ have shot himself by accid when enter the build if so thi wa the first shot fire the role of the media could have been a whole lot wors after an initi posit on the side of the batf the media began to come around to the view that thi might be a situat in which legal arm citizen held off a bad possibl illeg attack a real cynic might sai that the fbi went in when thei did becaus it wa clear that public opinion wa begin to chang side and the fbi want to act befor thei lost the public s sympathi should the batf be abolish no polic agenc _should_ be numer divers ineffici decentr etc better a few inept accid like thi than a move toward a singl larg well organ well train power domest polic forc which would eventu have even more tragic result lyn bate bate bbn com ps don kate will be give a shorter version of thi talk at boston colleg law school next tuesdai april 27 i don t know the exact time or place but presum a phone call to the bc law school could elicit that inform larri cipriani l v cipriani att com
