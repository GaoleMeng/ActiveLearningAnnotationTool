can someon cite biblic refer to homosexu be immor other than leviticu so far when i ask around here i get the vers from leviticu spout at me but the whole rest of that book tend to be ignor by christian haven t seen ani stone in a _long_ time later max bob muir the list wa post not long ago as i recal asid from lev commonli cite passag ar the stori of sodom note howev that thi wa a homosexu rape and there s no disagr that that is wrong i take an intermedi posit on thi note that sodom is refer to elsewher in the bibl for it sin it doesn t seem to have been known specif for homosexu rather i think it wa consid a cesspool of all sin howev from what we know of jewish attitud homosexu would have contribut to the horror of the action describ it almost seem to have been contriv to combin about as mani form of evil in on act as possibl homosexu rape of guest who were actual angel but thi stori is not specif about homosexu in the nt the clear refer ar all from paul s letter in rom 1 there is a passag that presuppos that homosexu is an evil note that the passag isn t about homosexu it s about idolatri homosexu is visit on peopl as a punish or at least result of idolatri there ar a number of argument over thi passag it doe not us the word homosexu and it is refer to peopl who ar by natur heterosexu practic homosexu so it s not what i d call an explicit teach against all homosexu but it doe seem to support what would be a natur assumpt anywai that paul share the gener neg jewish attitud toward homosexu the other passag occur in list of sin in i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 unfortun it s not entir clear what the word us here mean there have been suggest that on ha a broader mean such as wanton and that anoth mai be specif male prostitut again we don t have here a precis teach about homosexu but it is at least weak support evid that paul share the ot s neg judgement on homosexu jude 1 7 is sometim cite howev it s probabl not relev the context in jude involv angel sinc those who were almost rape in sodom were angel it seem like that strang flesh refer to intercours with angel as you can see the nt evid is such that peopl s conclus is determin by their approach to the bibl conserv note that the passag from paul s letter impli that he accept the ot prohibit thi is enough for them to regard it as have nt endors liber note that there s no specif teach and no clear definit of what is be prohibit or why is the concern in rom 1 the connect of homosexu to pagan worship what exactli do the word in the list of sin mean thu some believ it is legitim to regard thi as a attitud paul took with him from hi background and not a specif teach of the gospel thi is an explos topic which tend to result in long dissert on the exact mean of variou greek word but it s clear to me that that s mostli irrelev what it realli come down to is whether peopl ar look to the bibl for law or whether thei believ that such as approach is inconsist with the gospel thi appear to depend upon on s reaction to the messag of the bibl as a whole as well as on s percept of the need of the church todai thi is a differ of approach at least as seriou as the differ between protest and cathol in the 16th cent and on where both side believ that the bibl is so obvious on their side that thei keep think all thei have to do is quot a few more passag and the other side will final come to their sens that make thing veri frustrat for a moder who realiz that such an optimist outcom is not veri like clh
