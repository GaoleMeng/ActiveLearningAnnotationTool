ever sinc craig rowland post hi piec new encrypt to sci crypt there ha been some discuss of our compani secur commun technolog inc and on encrypt algorithm nea i spoke to craig at length on 4 21 93 and we cover a lot of ground some of the inform in the post requir some clarif and i would like to answer some of the question rais on sci crypt sct is a small compani base in silver spring maryland our two main product at thi time ar a pc base secur commun program call secom and a gener purpos encrypt chip which us the nea algorithm develop for secom secom provid an encrypt secur commun link between two pc s connect over dial up telephon line it support simultan bi direct file transfer and keyboard to screen chat it ha it own proprietari commun protocol which is tightli integr to the encrypt all though it is a packet link the data stream appear to be continu becaus the packet boundari ar hidden when secom wa initi develop it wa implement to us de encrypt a busi decis wa made to seek export approv for the product becaus it wa perceiv that the oversea market wa a larg on and provid a good market opportun we soon found out that we would never be grant gener export approv for anyth us de all though the reason for thi wa never explicitli state it seem to have someth to do with secret govern to govern agreement which ar still in effect in ani event the decis wa made to develop a new and differ algorithm which would take the place of de thi wa the reason nea new encrypt algorithm wa born at thi time nea is be held as a trade secret the preliminari work of patent it ha begun and the plan is to make it public onc the patent process is complet all though on can make certain legal argument for keep it an ongo secret i think in the case of an encrypt algorithm it is necessari to let peopl shoot at it over an extend period of time to prove it worth in order to get export approv for secom nea it wa necessari to go through nsa and to reveal to them the detail of the program and algorithm thi wa done onli after we had a finish product to submit let me state unequivoc that there is no back door to the program or the algorithm secur commun technolog is a close held privat compani and nsa fbi cia nist whatev ha no financi interest in ani wai whatsoev with the compani or ani of the peopl involv from a practic busi standpoint we ar interest in sell chip and softwar hopefulli in larg quantiti and a back door to the encrypt if found out could destroi our credibl and our busi with the encrypt algorithm approv for export we set out to talk to a number of potenti custom for encrypt product and system we were abl to identifi sever common thread of function requir thi led to the design of a chip with the encrypt algorithm cast in silicon and certain other capabl ad so that the chip could fulfil the broad rang of requir that we identifi we ar strongli oppos to the clipper capston chip in a press releas todai our presid dr stephen bryen state it seem as if the govern ha an unlimit sourc of fund to us to push it new bug chip on the american public but do we not understand how the nation secur agenc which is not suppos to be involv in domest spy can fund the develop of a commerci chip intend to accommod u s govern domest spy activ if thei had ask me to put a back door in nea i would have told them to g__ f____ed can nsa break nea or for that matter can thei break de rsa idea diffi hellman pgp rc2 rc4 or whatev i don t know and probabl never will
