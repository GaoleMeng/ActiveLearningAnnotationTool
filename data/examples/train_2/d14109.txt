from the jpl univers april 23 1993 vlbi project meet with intern space agenc by ed mcnevin member of jpl s space veri long baselin interferometri vlbi project team recent conclud a week long seri of meet with offici from russia and japan the meet were part of space vlbi week held at jpl in earli march and were intend to maintain cooper between intern space agenc particip in the develop of the u s space vlbi project a recent approv jpl flight project set for launch in 1995 u s space vlbi will util two earth orbit spacecraft the japanes vsop vlbi space observ program satellit with it 8 meter radio telescop and a russian radioastron 10 meter satellit both spacecraft will team up with ground base radio telescop locat around the world to creat a radio telescop network that astronom hope will expand radio telescop observ power by a factor of 10 japan s vsop satellit will us a limit six hour orbit to conduct imag scienc while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger 28 hour earth orbit to conduct exploratori radio astronomi each satellit will point at a sourc target for roughli 24 hour while approxim 20 ground base radio telescop will simultan point at the same sourc object while within view on earth accord to dr joel smith jpl s project manag for the u s space vlbi meet like those held at jpl will permit japan and russia who have littl previou experi in radio interferometri to establish work relationship with the radio astronomi commun that will be vital dure the complex observ requir by the space vlbi project on of our main activ is develop the methodolog for intern coordin becaus the two spacecraft simultan reli on the correspond track station while us the ground base radio telescop to observ the same celesti object said smith three new track antenna ar be built at dsn facil and other three other track facil locat in japan russia and green bank w va thi global network of ground base radio telescop will us precis clock and high speed record to collect observ data and forward the inform to a correl locat at the nation radio astronomi observatori in socorro n m the correl will combin and process data then make it avail to mission investig in moscow tokyo and jpl via electron mail smith is optimist that the massiv radio telescop creat by the space vlbi network will provid radio astronom with better resolut than ha ever been achiev befor by ground base radio telescop allow astronom to take a closer look at distant object in space there is a long histori of radio astronomi us ground base telescop said smith what we intend to do is to extend radio astronomi into earth orbit our goal is to look deeper into the core of galact nuclei quasar and other activ radio sourc to understand what drive those thing we have seen so far with radio astronomi smith note that if on examin the activ galact nuclei you ll find jet appear to spew at speed greater than light and at energi level that ar million of time greater than you would expect he said some astronom believ that black hole mai be locat in the core of these galaxi and that thei mai fuel the jet smith hope that by us space vlbi to look further into the core thi theori mai be support or disprov russian space flight hardwar includ transpond and transmitt ar now be test in the unit state and japanes hardwar is schedul to arriv for test later thi year analysi of thi hardwar will permit u s scientist and engin to understand how to modifi the high speed vlba correl oper at the nrao in order to accommod the odd data pattern that will origin from the more than 20 ground base radio telescop involv in space vlbi smith is particularli pleas that meet with the japanes and russian space agenc offici like those held at jpl in march have proceed smoothli yet he know that the polit uncertainti in russia could jeopard that countri s particip in the project noth is ever smooth he said but the russian have been incred open with us we alwai anticip some likelihood that we will not succe becaus of polit factor beyond our control yet there tend to be a wai of keep these thing go becaus scientist on both side ar try hard and peopl recogn the valu of cooper at thi level smith point out that the japanes space agenc ha more at stake than just fulfil an intern commit to a scienc mission the japanes have been extrem cooper sinc intern cooper is essenti to their scienc mission he said but smith also note that japanes space agenc offici look at the u s space vlbi mission as an opportun to showcas the technolog involv with vsop spacecraft and their highli regard mach v launch vehicl yet regardless of the risk involv in undertak such an ambiti project jpl s smith is satisfi that plan for the space vlbi project is beyond the signific financi and polit hurdl that otherwis might threaten the project fortun we have the virtu of have two partner and if either fall out we would still have someth with the other by themselv both spacecraft ar independ scientif excit mission
