kuusama kaarn cs tut fi kuusama juha vtt write not that the question is anyth import but i am still curiou why is that almost all print circuit board ar green i have seen a few blue on but no red yellow compani logo etc is there a technic reason or could it be that the market genius have not tought about it yet the green layer is a solder mask and is us to make a finish board look neat and to avoid solder bridg especi when us wave solder or ani other mechan approach i ve seen red mask but most that i ve seen ar green a bakelit board will look brown in colour and if the solder mask is put on look like a brown board with green paint on either side or just on side of the board a fibreglass board will look green from the side becaus the green solder mask make the board appear that colour if you got a fibreglass board with no mask it would be a whitish grei colour teflon board do exist as well but i m not sure about that on i d guess the stuff thei invent for solder mask wa green so thei re not about to chang also ani chang in ani chemic probabl requir a better than normal clean of the machin that make board a lot of compani do not make their own board thei ship them to a real boardhous
