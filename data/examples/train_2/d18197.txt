why should anyon check let s restrict thi to christian why do we want to find command in the book regard as scriptur what s go on i will pass on psycholog answer whether dismiss or more open as not the kind of issu to deal with here the question is what is the theolog point involv and it ha been quot at me often enough by those who don t believ i take it serious that jesu is said to have said if you love me you will obei my command john 14 15 i am like ani christian the slave of christ and it is my will that i should do as he will me to do i am also or instead hi younger brother but still under hi direct though we both call god abba christian therefor will try to find what it is that their lord command them and discov it will feel oblig to do it or to confess their failur reader here mai set asid the theolog jargon such as slave of christ the point is that adher of a religion will read the text whether classifi as inspir or not that ar held up as model in an effort to find applic to their own situat thi practic rang from devot read of sermon and the like to the exegesi of canon ical scriptur as the word of god and at the highest pitch thi lead to a question of whether we can find in inspir scriptur someth that can act as absolut guidanc for our action the problem is in find out just what it is our lord command i am go to set asid for thi essai on major direct in which christian have look for these command name christian tradit that is not becaus i reject tradit but becaus my primari audienc in thi essai is protest who deni tradit a determin valu in favor of the wit of scriptur the question i want to deal with is what command can we find from our lord in scriptur and that turn out to be a hard question if ani of my protest inquisitor would like to turn the discuss to the author of tradit i can accomod them unlik most protest episcopalian admit claim from a scriptur b reason and c tradit on roughli equal stand earlier in john than my quot abov we read john 13 34 i give you a new command love on anoth thi is the onli place in the nt where christian ar given an explicit command with the context comment on it imper mode pronounc by jesu at the same meal so we reader infer sinc it is not in john but in the synopt jesu sai take thi bread thi is my bodi mark 14 22 cf matthew 26 26 luke 22 19 1 corinthian 11 24 the mode is imper greek _labet_ and henc thi too is a command in both case we have to infer that the command is direct to a wider circl than the immedi colloc of discipl becaus we judg the evangelist s point in mention it with the discipl by then mostli or entir dead is that we ar expect to follow thi as a command from our lord in the case of communion paul s mention at least thi is probabl true of the evangelist also impli an ongo ritual liturgi in which these word oper to bind christian to the origin command to hi discipl as a continu command to the christian commun i am entir comfort with thi infer but i must point out that it is there between us and the occas on which jesu spoke the command i take it as a clear infer at the veri least the evangelist s notion that all christian ar call to love on anoth in jesu command direct at the discipl but i have to call attent to the infer the command cannot appli to me without the gener from the specif context of it statement to my own context as a discipl of christ all read of scriptur ha to make such infer to get ani sens out of the text whatsoev thi is a gener problem in read these text we cannot read them at all without our own understand of our nativ languag in which we normal read the translat text and without some appreci of the origin context and at point the origin languag when english mislead us i am go to presum in what follow that we have the gener problem of how to read scriptur under control i don t realli think thi is true but it will suffic for my current purpos i will address onli the issu that aris when we have alreadi cope with the understand of a 2000 year old text from anoth world than the on we live in question at that level onli introduc more reser vation about the command issu than will be found stipul that we can read the text as the origin audienc might have done among the reason we have for see john s _agap allel_ as a gener command not mere an instruct by jesu to thi discipl on that on occas and on link it to the synopt great command is that we have critic from jesu about limit our love to those whom we congeni associ with in matthew 5 43ff we read you have learnt how it wa said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemi but i sai to you love your enemi in fact the leviticu context quot doe not sai hate your enemi it is mere the common human presumpt and leviticu is at pain to sai that the love should extend to stranger amongst the peopl of israel luke in expand on thi same q context goe on to have jesu sai even sinner love those who love them 6 27 all of thi suggest quit strongli i d sai that limit the scope of the new command is not quit what jesu ha in mind in short infer lead me to gener the actual text to a command that is in forc on christian and with object not limit to other christian trickier than the _agap allel_ or institut of communion there is the case of the great commiss where matthew 10 mark 6 the twelv ar sent out to evangel proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand the verb is imper _ke russet_ but the context is rather specif to the twelv and there ar further specifi as in do not turn your step to pagan territori and do not enter ani samaritan town the lukan parallel ar even more specif to jesu final journei to jerusalem which make it harder to see thi gener to all christian than the previou exampl that hasn t prevent christian from make such an infer what i have to call attent to is that such infer is not justifi in the text nor unlik the first two case i cite by the rhetor of the evangelist urg on the reader still paul seem to have felt oblig to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand even contrari to jesu instruct to the 12 to the gentil to the end of the earth so christian after him have also taken thi as a command in the sens of john 14 15 do i accept thi i don t know it is sure rather specul but you see how the rippl of infer spread out from the text that is the pretext christian mai infer a gener command applic to all from what is present in the gospel as a specif occas i do not necessarili object to thi kind of gener but i insist that peopl who make it must have an understand that thei ar reason at some consider length from what we actual have in scriptur there ar assumpt involv in thi reason and these ar not themselv scriptur though peopl will do their best to justifi their assumpt by other refer to scriptur which simpli add more infer into the mix let s move on to the great command that we should love god with our whole heart and mind and soul thi is perhap the synopt equival of john s _agap allel_ and yet it is not present as a command in our text rather the context is controversi with the pharise to cite matthew 22 34ff but when the pharise heard that he had silenc the sadduce thei got togeth and to disconcert him on of them put a question master which is the greatest command of the law it is by no mean obviou here though i accept it as such that jesu answer is meant to be a command to christian he is answer a polem from hi enemi mark s account in 12 28 34 cast the answer in a far more posit light as so the scribe in thi version sai far more import than ani holocaust i need to point out that thi word origin in the context of anim sacrific forget the nazi for thi or sacrific luke is intermedi he ha a lawyer pose the question to disconcert jesu and get the good samarian parabl for hi pain luke 10 25 37 the context here ar so confusingli variou that on could be forgiven for draw no infer in no account is thi said as if it were obvious to be taken as a command bind on christian though i think it an entir reason conclus in each case that jesu think it to be so the point is that our mental gear have to grind a cycl or so to get to ani conclus from all of thi about what we ar command to do by jesu and all of thi is conting on our understand the point of jesu us of the torah in the all quit differ gospel account and the applic of such a context to us the differ context among the synopt ar curiou it should be note that onli in luke do we get the fix of thi command by the parabl of the good samaritan we mai look for an analog intent in matthew where 7 12 give the golden rule as the mean of the law and the prophet and where we mai also hear an echo of hillel sai the same a gener befor jesu if we make these associ which i think ar entir reason we ar again indulg in infer the text do not explicitli support us rather we read the text as have thi kind of inter relationship current literari theori call thi intertextu my discuss of why the _agap allel_ ha to appli beyond the commun of the discipl and beyound the circl of christian believ appli again here to buttress a conclus that thi is despit the present not sai so explicitli a command to christian few christian would disagre with my conclus but i must point out that thei ar conclus thei depend on rather elabor chain of reason that ar simpli not present in the text themselv the contextu problem keep come up more and more sever as we look at those sai of jesu that ar not so univers taken by christian as command and we get some realli hard case take divorc mark is pretti clear the man who divorc hi wife and marri anoth is guilti of adulteri against her 10 11 cf luke 16 18 except that matthew ha an escap claus except in the case of fornic 5 31 thi seem to be a rather clear command whether or not we take matthew s reserv and some christian to thi dai take it so but some don t at least in practic thi is rather peculiar it is not as if jesu were not explicit about thi wherea he sai noth at all about some of the thing peopl gnash their teeth over how is it possibl if the command of christ ar clear that matthew can so disagre with the other evangelist of the synopt tradit i m go to continu thi examin into ever murkier water but thi is enough to start with the theme is find command in scriptur is an exercis in infer our infer ar inform by our assumpt that is our own cultur bias i have so far identifi a veri few command that ar gener accept by all christian and yet in these alreadi some of the difficulti start to surfac it is these difficulti i want to discuss in my next essai on thi topic the divorc command alreadi strike at some of the difficulti i see almost no evid that the peopl who ar so eager to find command to condemn me with spend ani time at all write nasti screed to soc coupl or misc legal about the horror or vicious of divorc or demand that us law refus to allow it or refus unrepent divorce place in their church that is not to sai that divorc doesn t enter into consider in gener it is most definit a matter of concern in even the most liber church circl for exampl a wildli liber episcopalian priest of my aqauint in a wildli liber dioces ha recommend to a coupl who approach him to marri them that thei have a privat secular ceremoni befor a judg so that the public ceremoni he celebr need not go through an agon examin by offici who would just as soon not take on thi role of interpret the command we ar face with as christian thi in a church that wa effect creat by a famou divorc michael l siemon
