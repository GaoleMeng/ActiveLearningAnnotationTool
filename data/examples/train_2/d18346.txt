refer to orthodox belief and sai ra thing like it is held that cf kermit thread on what ra exact bodi of theologi ar you draw for what you call orthodox orthodox is a compound word it come from ortho straight true right and from doxa opinion doctrin teach i us orthodox to refer to right teach as oppos to univers or cathol or foursquar gospl i think that the greek orthodox church would take high offens at your misus of the word your version of christian is neither mainstream nor bibl deriv you make claim of bibl centric that ar not deriv solei from the bibl about six seven month ago you claim that your primari object to the ld wa that our doctrin wa not bibl deriv and now thi and other claim can be shown ar also not bibl interpet bibl right teach is deriv from let god speak to us through the bibl thi can be from read simpl truth in the scriptur and by us the bibl to interpret the bibl simpl truth oh for exampl ra who is that hold that luke meant what you said he meant i think that it is appar from read the scriptur that ar pertin luke 23 43 record christ s promis to the repent thief who hung on an adjac cross truli i sai to you todai you will be with me in paradis but wa it not until later that christ rose from the dead and ascend to heaven if christ himself wa not in heaven until sundai how could the repent thief have been there with him the answer li in the locat of paradis when jesu di appar paradis wa not exalt to heaven until easter dai paradis exalt to heaven paradis wasn t equal to heaven and _now_ it is yet you claim that peepl can not be exalt to heaven nicht wahr jesu refer to it in the middl of the stori of the rich man and lazaru as abraham s bosom to which the godli beggar lazaru wa carri by the angel after hi deceas luke 16 19 31 thu abraham s bosom refer to the place where the soul of the redeem wait till the dai of christ s resurrect when i read the stori i found that abraham s bosom wasn t so much a place but somewher the rich man could see and talk to abraham it wa not yet lift to heaven but it mai well have been a section of hade hebrew sheol reserv for believ who had di in the faith but would not be admit into the gloriou presenc of god in heaven until the price of redempt had actual been paid on calvari or even that none would preced the presenc of jesu back to glori with the father gee thi is fairli close to what the ld call spirit prison and what you have call fals doctrin doubtless it wa the infern paradis that the soul of jesu and the repent thief repair after thei each di on fridai afternoon but on sundai after the risen christ had first appear to mari magdalen john 20 17 and her two companion matthew 28 9 presum he then took up with him to glori all the inhabit of infern paradis includ abraham lazaru and the

of liber captiv from hade i e the whole popul of preresurrect paradis up to the glori of heaven thi part is _not_ support from scriptur nor doe it support your claim that the paradis where christ

in love mai grow up into him in all thing which is the head us thi to argu that paradis or spirit prison is now chang from a pre easter postion to post easter by god postion is not support make such a claim requir more evid than you have given here ra whenev your person interpret of biblic passag is ra challeng your onli respons seem to be that on need mere to ra look at the bibl in order to see the truth but what of those who ra see biblic thing differ from you i think that thi character is faulti whenev my person interpret is question i usual give a reason ye and your reason ar in gener not support by ani direct read of the scriptur you have demonstr that you claim to scriptur proof need to be cross check the referenc that you suppli often do not support your postion if thei ar read in the context of the scriptur as for those that see thing differ pleas put forward where there is a valid differ and we can discuss it i seem to be see from you the notion that ani differ in how on view the bibl is somehow legitim except or cours for the stuff that i glean from it put forward a contrari view and perhap we can have a discuss on that topic but to decri someth that i put forward without put forward someth els to discuss and to dismiss what i put forward while give credenc to other alleg view that have yet to be put forward is simpli be contenti how about that those who have been in paradis and have accept the gospl will be judg of jesu christ and then return to the presenc of god is that somehow differ from your express view that the paradis spoken of or abraham s bosom ra ar we to simpli assum that you ar the onli on who realli ra understand it if you believ that someth that i have drawn from scriptur is wrong then pleas show me from scriptur where it is wrong simpli state that there ar other view is not a proof show it to me from scriptur and then we can go on should we go back and discuss your view on why the angl of the lord is the lord again robert weiss psyrobtw
