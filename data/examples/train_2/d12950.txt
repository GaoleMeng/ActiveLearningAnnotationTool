nore syndrom to the yoghurt and vitamin therapi of undocu candida enter elain palmer syndrom with system symptom there is signific differ between the cost and risk of these two empir therapeut trial ar we talk about real candida infect the whole yeast connect hypothesi the efficaci of routin bacteri repopul in human or the abil of anecdot effect therapi challeng by a neg random trial to confirm an etiolog hypothesi post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focu in on a diseas a therapi or a hypothesi under discuss i m lost point 1 i m begin to see that part of the disagr about the whole yeast issu is on differ percept and on differ mean of word medic doctor have a veri specif and special jargon necessari for precis commun within their field which i m fulli cogniz of sinc i too speak jargones when with my peer for the situat in sci med mani time the word or phrase us by doctor can have a differ and more specif mean than the same word us in the world at larg caus signific miscommun on exampl word and veri relev to the yeast discuss is the exact mean of system it is now obviou to me that the mean of thi word is veri specif much more so than it mean to a non doctor there is also the observ of thi newsgroup that both doctor and non doctor come togeth on essenti equal term which when combin with the jargon issu can further fan the flame thi is probabl the first time that practic doctor get realli beat up by non doctor for their view on medicin which thei otherwis don t see much of in their practic except for the occasion difficult patient point 2 i understand the viewpoint among mani practic doctor that thei will not prescrib ani treatment therapi for their patient unless such treatment have been shown to be effect and the risk understood from well construct clinic trial usual doubl blind or that such treatment therapi ar part of an approv and fund clinic trial to these doctor to do ani differ would in thi belief system be uneth practic and it follow that ani therapi not on the accept list is therefor a non therapi it doe not even exist nor doe the underli hypothesi or theori have ani valid even if it sound veri plausibl by extrapol of what is current known anecdot evid ha no valu either from a treatment point of view and by and larg as a scientist myself i am glad that medic practic scienc take such a rigor approach to medic treatment howev as also be a human be last i check and have been on of those peopl that ha been significantli help by a current unaccept treatment where standard medicin wa not abl to help me ha caus me to sit back and wonder if hold such an extrem and rigid scientif viewpoint is in itself uneth from humanitarian consider after all the underli intent of the scientif approach to medicin is to protect the health of the patient by provid the best possibl care for the patient so the patient should come first when consid treatment what we need is a slightli modifi approach to treatment that satisfi both the scientif and the humanitarian viewpoint in an earlier post i outlin a crazi idea for do just that the gist of it wa to give ani physician freedom and encourag by the medic commun to prescrib altern not yet proven therapi mayb support by anecdot evid for patient who all avenu of accept therapi have been exhaust and not until then the patient would be fulli inform that such therapi treatment ar not support by the proper clinic trial and that there ar real potenti risk with real possibl of no benefit deriv from them thi approach satisfi the need for scientif rigor it also satisfi the humanitarian need of the patient and the realiti is that mani patient who have reach a dead end in the treatment of their symptom us accept medicin will go outsid the orthodox medic commun either to the doctor who ar brave enough to prescrib such treatment at the risk of lose their licens or wors to non doctor who have not had the proper medic train thi approach also recogn thi realiti and keep the control more within orthodox medicin with the benefit that the inform glean could help focu limit resourc toward futur clinic trial in the most product wai everybodi win in thi admittedli rose color approach i m sure there ar real problem with thi approach as well it is present more as a strawman to stimul discuss hopefulli what i write here mai give the sci med doctor a better idea as to why i am open to altern therapi as well as why i have real difficulti read appar hostil with the cold of the 99 9% pure scientif approach to medicin i believ the best approach to medic treatment is on where both the humanitarian aspect ar balanc with and by the scientif aspect anyth els is just not good medicin imho just my nf lean i guess comment jon nore charter member infj club if you re dy to
