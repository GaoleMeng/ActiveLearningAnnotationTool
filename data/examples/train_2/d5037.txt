there is anoth us method base on least sqyar estim of the sphere equat paramet the point x y z on a spheric surfac with radiu r and center a b c can be written as x a 2 y b 2 z c 2 r 2 thi equat can be rewritten into the follow form 2ax 2by 2cz r 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 approxim the left hand part by f x y z p1 x p2 x p3 z p4 1 for all datapoint i c 4 determin the 4 paramet p1 p4 which minimis the averag error f x y z x 2 y 2 z 2 2 in numer recip in c can be found algorithm to solv these paramet the best fit sphere will have center a b c p1 2 p2 2 p3 2 radiu r sqrt p4 a a b b c c so at last will thi solv you sphere estin problem at least for the most situat i think quick van rijt rytg7 fel tno nl
