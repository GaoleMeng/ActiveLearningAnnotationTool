i am seek some altern solut on how to turn a postscript type 1 or truetyp font outlin into polygon that can be subsequ scan convert by a 3d scanlin render i have been studi the problem of font convers for a few year but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportun to write some font render softwar so i would like to have some of my question answer befor i jump into the deep end the main problem i face is how to us the even odd or non wind rule to turn the outlin into a singl outlin polygon my render can handl complex polygon so there is no need to reduc the polygon to simpl polygon for exampl in the letter o there ar two outlin 1 the outsid outlin which is clockwis truetyp font 2 the insid outlin which is counterclockwis on common solut us by a number of render packag is to simpli connect the inner outlin to the outer outlin at the point where the two outlin ar closest thi is equival to descib a polygon with hole the render will then make the appropri hole sinc the interior polygon edg ar in the opposit direct to the outsid edg i do not want to us thi simplist system sinc 1 it will not handl all outlin font properli it is not a simpl matter to connect the outer outlin to the inner outlin for some fanci font 2 it doe not properli handl the even odd or non wind rule from my research over the year the proper solut is to us a trapezoid decomposit algorithm to scan convert the outlin into trapezoid as is done by the postscript and truetyp font raster these trapezoid polygon can then be easili and properli render by the 3d scanlin render my question is ar there ani better solut to turn the outlin into polgyon other than the trapezoid decompos i am not fond of thi solut sinc it creat excess number of polygon anoth question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to creat bevel and or offset curv for font outlin i have a dozen paper on these subject but i can t tell which method is the best to implement thank for ani pointer rob lansdal robert lansdal 416 978 6619 dynam graphic project internet lansd dgp toronto edu comput system research institut uucp uunet dgp toronto edu lansd univers of toronto bitnet
