the recent rise of nostalgia in thi group combin with the incred level of utter bullshit ha prompt me to comb through my archiv and pull out some of the best of alt atheism for your read pleasur i ll post a coupl of these a dai unless group concensu demand that i stop or i run out of good materi i haven t been particularli care in the past about save attribut i think the follow come from john a johnson but someon correct me if i m wrong thi is probabl the longest of my entir collect ________________________________________________________ so that the propheci be fulfil in consid the christian religion and judg it accord to it claim it is import to look at it claim at fulfil earlier jewish propheci the scribe matthew is perhap the most eager to draw out what he think ar prophet answer in the career of jesu of nazareth as you will see matthew s main strategi is to take variou old testament passag often not even about the promis messiah and appli them to the circumst in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authent of the account sinc the gospel were written at least 35 year after jesu wa execut we do not know how much happen exactli as state but for purpos of analysi we will take particular claim at face valu immanuel we begin of cours at the begin mt 1 21 22 mari will bear a son and you joseph will name him jesu which mean g d is salvat for he will save hi peopl from their sin all thi happen to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet isaiah 7 1 16 in the dai of ahaz c 750 bce king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quit conquer it when the hous of david i e ahaz and hi court in judah were told of thi it heart and the heart of it peopl shook and the lord g d said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah natur sai ask a sign of g d your lord it can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven but ahaz said i won t ask i will not put the lord to a test then isaiah said hear then o hous of david is it not enough for you to weari men that you must weari my god too therefor the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him immanuel which mean g d is with us he will eat curd and honei when he know how to refus evil and choos good for befor the child know how to refus evil and choos good the land of the two king you dread will have been desert matthew home in on just the sentenc that is in ital further he the hebrew word almah young woman as specif virgin but thi is not a propheci about the messiah it is not a propheci about an event to happen 750 year later it is not a propheci about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesu matthew ha made us of a vers out of context and tri to make it fit the specif case of mari it should be note that if we want to read the propheci in a gener manner a veri gener on it can be made to fit mari mari virgin or not wa inde a young woman with child of cours the fit is shadi and ha problem jesu while thought of by later christian to be g d walk among men wa never call by the name immanuel if christian wish to claim thi propheci for jesu it becom at best a cut and past propheci a second class propheci not too convinc egypt after jesu s birth in bethlehem matthew tell about a quick and elsewher unment excurs to egypt as if he wish to liken jesu to mose thi wa done to escap an alleg infanticid rampag of the king herod mt 2 15 and remain there until the death of herod thi wa to fulfil what the lord had spoken out of egypt i have cal led my son what the lord realli said wa thi hosea 11 1 when israel wa a child i love him and out of egypt i call my son the more i call them my peopl the more thei went from me thei kept sacrif to the ba al and kept burn incens to idol matthew conveni omit the rest of hosea s oracl but it wa inde israel that onc call out of egypt want to return thi is histori jesu is certainli not be spoken of here and if we ar to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesu that flee and resist g d again thi propheci is just not as convinc as matthew probabl had hope rachel weep while jesu is off vacat in egypt matthew sai that king herod sought to kill him and thu order the execut of all young male children matthew then write mt 2 17 18 by thi that which wa spoken by the prophet jeremiah wa fulfil a voic wa heard in ramah wail and loud lament rachel weep for her children she refus to be consol becaus thei were no more the refer is to a passag in jeremiah 31 15 refer to the carri off of israel into exil by sargon of assyria in 722 bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribe of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descend who ar no more it is metaphor of cours sinc rachel live and di befor the hebrew were even in the egyptian exil it is interest to note that it wa leah not rachel who wa the ancestor of the judean the land where jesu and bethlehem were if anyon should do weep for her children it is leah the onli connexion that rachel ha with bethlehem is that the legend have it that she wa buri north of the citi on the wai to ephrath bethlehem as for herod and hi infanticid it is rather unlik that such an event actual occur on never know but the event is not mention or allud to anywher els in the bibl nor is it mention in ani of the secular record of the time herod wa particularli unlik in hi reign and mani far less evil deed of herod were carefulli record thi might be a prime exampl of how event were ad to jesu s life to enhanc the messag of the church s gospel becaus of the whole stori s similar to the tale of the infant mose in egypt it is highli like that it is a devic set up by matthew to add prophet yet artifici approv of jesu it is not surpris that matthew conveni neglect to mention the rest of the jeremiah quot the children the prophet speak of ar not dead but exil in the assyrian empir g d comfort the weep rachel sai that the children will be return he will gather them back togeth of cours thi would not suit matthew s purpos as the children he speak of ar dead for good again the propheci matthew set up is not even that and to anyon who bother to check it out is not too convinc the nazaren we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find anoth matthean propheci after leav egypt joseph wife take the infant jesu to live in the citi of nazareth mt 2 23 that what wa spoken of by the prophet might be fulfil he shall be call a nazaren first thing we notic is that matthew doe not mention the name of the prophet s thi time second we have to ask who he is there ar no messian propheci speak of a nazaren wors there ar no propheci period mention a nazaren still wors there ar no nazaren mention in the old testament at all in the book of judg an angel tell samson s mother that she will judg 13 5 conceiv and bear a son no razor shall tough hi head for he will be a nazirit to hi god from the dai of hi birth he will deliv israel from the hand of the philistin thi is of cours not a propheci of jesu or the messiah of g d but it is the best that can be found obvious matthew ha begun to go overboard in cut and past propheci in that he is simpl make them up now bear our diseas jesu next goe around heal peopl of physic ill and disabl mt 8 17 thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet isaiah he took our infirm and bore our diseas as expect the vers quot in isaiah is quot out of context and a few word ar skew to fit the christian scheme we have is 53 4 sure he the suffer servant ha born our sick and carri our pain from a read of the surround passag in isaiah we know that the prophet is speak in present tens of the collect nation of israel jehovah s chosen servant and peopl he speak to the israelit suffer in exil in the voic of the gentil nation that look upon it thi imag is deepli ingrain in jewish ident an imag of a chastis yet cherish israel as the instrument of the nation salvat by g d the vers speak of israel take on the sick which ar the liter and metaphor manifest of guilt and disciplin thei do not speak of a servant go around and heal peopl notic that the servant in isaiah take on the sick and pain of the nation and individu jew jesu as we all know did not take the diseas onto himself the vers here in isaiah ar not a propheci of someth to come but rather someth that had alreadi happen while it is believ that jesu took on the etern punish of hell he did not bear the ill he heal so while someon might want to sai that figur jesu reenact the deed of israel in hi spiritu aton he ha to admit that matthew s parallel miss where he intend it to have it effect silent messiah upon heal multitud of common it is said that jesu order them to keep quiet presum so that he wouldn t arous the attent of the local ruler mt 12 15 21 thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet isaiah behold my servant whom i have chosen my belov with whom my soul is pleas i will put my spirit on him and he will announc justic to the gentil he will not wrangl or cry aloud nor will anyon hear hi voic in the street he will not break a bruis reed or quench a smolder wick until he bring justic to victori and the gentil will hope in hi name the isaiah passag quot read is 42 1 4 behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delight i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justic to the nation we will not cry or lift up hi voic or make it heard in the street he will not break a bruis reed or quench a smolder wick he will faithfulli bring forth justic he will not fail burn dimli or be discourag bruis until he ha establish justic in the earth and the coastland await hi law you see matthew ha conveni left out part of the passag becaus it doe not suit the deal of jesu christian could never think of jesu fail never would the light of mankind burn dimli but the servant nation of israel will inde come to an end when it job is done when the gentil come to embrac g d there will no longer be a chosen peopl but rather all will be the children of g d also the end phrase ha been chang from the judaic the coastland await hi law to the christolog the gentil will hope in hi name while the origin proclaim the torah law of jehovah the other rewrit it to fit it strang doctrin of believ in the name if on ha ani doubt the servant refer to is not jesu on ha onli to read the whole chapter isaiah 42 and hear about the belov but blind and imperfect servant a peopl rob and plunder so we see that when matthew s attempt at propheci is examin it crumbl three dai and three night now we come upon a propheci supposedli utter by the veri mouth of the god jesu himself he speak of hi crucifixion and resurrect mt 12 40 for as jonah wa in the belli of the whale for three dai and three night so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three dai and three night befor ani further discuss can occur it is necessari to know how the jew understood dai as far as dai name went each wa 24 hour long last from sunset 6pm to the follow sunset 6pm what wa refer to as a dai wa the period of light from 6am to the end sunset at 6pm thu accord to our time scale a sabbath dai began at 6pm fridai even and last until 6pm saturdai even thi is why the jew celebr their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdai instead of sundai it seem like a real miracl that christian didn t forget that saturdai wa inde the seventh and last dai of the week thu when dai and night ar refer to togeth 12 hour daylight portion and 12 hour night period ar be spoken of thu jesu sai that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwis unresurrect for three dai and three night as the good book tell us jesu wa crucifi on the ninth hour which is 3pm fridai afternoon he then wa put into the grave sometim after that then jesu left the grave rose befor dawn of what we call sundai the dawn after the sabbath wa over what thi mean is that jesu wa us our time for clariti in the grave from 6pm fridai night to some time befor 6am sundai morn we could also add a littl time befor 6pm fridai sinc the bibl is not specif here what thi mean us jewish time is that he wa in the grave for on dai two night and possibl a coupl of hour of on dai certainli thi is a problem for jesu predict there is absolut no wai we ar even abl to have hi death involv three dai and three night even us modern time measur we then ar led to suspect that thi error is anoth on of matthew s littl mistak and that the gospel writer put fals word into hi god s mouth and no matter who made the predict it is more than unconvinc it is counter convinc hear understand jesu tool on a habit of speak to hi vast audienc in parabl stori in which a deeper mean could be found if you were alreadi on of the elect those chosen to understand the messag of jesu he reason that those who can understand the parabl ar the on he want if the peopl cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them sinc thei will not accept the plain messag ani better matthew sai mt 13 14 16 with them the audienc inde in fulfil the propheci of isaiah which sai you will inde hear but never understand and you will inde see but never perceiv becaus thi peopl s heart ha grown dull their ear ar heavi of hear and thei have shut their ey so the thei would not perceiv with them her with their ear and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the origin isaiah passag ar part of hi earlier work hi call to the ministri thi is in 740 bce when israel is flourish right befor it fall under the author of assyria isaiah see the good time end and also a vision from g d call him to bring reform to israel and judah is 6 9 13 and g d said go and sai to thi peopl hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceiv make the heart of thi peopl fat make their ear heavi and shut their ey so thei will not see with their ey or hear with their ear and understand with their heart and turn and be heal then isaiah said how long lord and he said until the citi lie wast without inhabit and hous without men and the land is utterli desol and the g ds take men far awai and forsaken place ar mani in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burn again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stand when the tree is fell the holi seed is it stump here we see that it is realli g d who caus the peopl of israel to stop listen to the prophet s warn but reaffirm the promis made to solomon s and david s seed lineag if you read the rest of isaiah you find that thi is done to fulfil the plan of g d to us israel as a servant a light to the nation look at isaiah 42 18 25 48 20 49 3 we see that matthew ha cut and past just a littl portion of isaiah s vers to suit hi own gospel need more than that he ha alter the word to make it fit the peopl who didn t understand jesu s stori and as we see isaiah s vers ar not propheci but rather command from g d to him in the present onc again matthew s propheci fall flat on it face matthew tri again to make jesu s parabl look like thei have the prophet approv mt 13 35 he said noth to them without a parabl thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parabl i will utter that which ha been hidden sinc the foundat of the world matthew realli botch up here he attempt to quot not from a prophet but from the psalm ps 78 2 4 i will open my mouth in parabl i will utter dark sai of old thing that we all have heard and known thing that our father have told us we will not hide them from their children but tell to the come gener the gloriou deed of the lord as wa point out the vers in the psalm do not realli come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copi of matthew s gospel even insert isaiah s name as thi prophet appar later scribe caught the error and tri to cover some of it up perhap the most signific part of thi is that onc again matthew ha alter the old testament scriptur as jesu ha said earlier he speak in parabl so that some will not understand them the parabl in the psalm ar not to be hidden further thei speak of thing known that our father have told us jesu deal with thing hidden sinc the foundat of the world inde jesu dealt in a lot of secreci and confus thi is in direct opposit to the parabl in the psalm no wonder matthew had to rewrit them and still onc again matthew s artifici propheci fall flat on their face but christian rare look at thi matthew s propheci aren t the onli thing about christian that ar begin to look bad excus of littl faith in mt 17 14 21 we see that the discipl ar abl to go around cast out demon except in on case not know what epilepsi wa the peopl thought those with the diseas were posses with demon it is no wonder that the discipl were unabl to dispossess the epilept but jesu perhap no more enlighten than thei is report to have rebuk them sai thei didn t have enough faith thi seem strang why wa thi demon special it seem that either a true believ ha faith or he doe not appar enough faith will allow someon to move mountain of cours you will find no on these dai that can move real mountain no on part sea the onli miracl the charismat can speak of ar those rumour to happen on trip to mexico or some farawai place major miracl ar make some old woman s arthriti feel better on sundai morn t v and the god includ jesu ar alwai shroud in ancient lore and write protect from the skeptic in their sacr past thei ar either dead sleep or hide in heaven with peopl rumour about their immin return and their great miracl of dai long gone yet life goe on tale of mystic stori of miracl all in a distant time or a distant place god us to reveal themselv to men in the old dai jehovah too but now thei ar silent all the theologian give ar variou excus as to why we don t get to see god anymor we re too lazi we re not zealou enough we re sin it s just hi plan we put too mani of our own demand on g d s appear if we had the right faith if we were will to meet g d on hi term yet even the most piou of men have not seen g d you dear reader have not seen g d not liter you know that to be true i know that s presumptu and bold but search your heart you know what i mean all that we ve seen religion do is make peopl feel good and content about not see g d thei sai our littl faith doe not merit us to see g d sometim thei sai see the love in these peopl you worship with see the live of peopl chang that is see g d thu peopl get lull to sleep satisfi with turn g d into the everydai sight but that is not see g d as i am speak of it is not see g d the wai peopl us to see what we see in the world that is good is the compass of human heart the love given and taken by men and women the forgiv practis by christian atheist alik beauti creat by the mind of man these ar the thing that ar done these ar what we see but it is said thi is so onli becaus everybodi ha littl faith jesu ride on an ass shortli after accept the role of the jewish messiah king jesu request a donkei be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem mt 21 5 thi took place to fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet sai tell the daughter of zion behold your king is come to you humbl mount on an ass and on a ass colt of cours the passag quot from zechariah 9 9 read a littl differ lo your king come to you he is triumphant and victori humbl and ride on an ass on an ass colt he will command peac to the nation there isn t all that much differ here except that zechariah onli involv on anim an ass colt while matthew read the poetic word slightli differ thu he ha jesu call for both a colt and an adult ass from matthew s version we get a comic pictur of the divin christ sweat it to straddl two donkei thi could inevit lead to a theolog proctolog dilemma we find that in the account written earlier by st mark onli the colt wa call for and brought to jesu thi inde fit the vers of zechariah properli and show us that in matthew attempt to us prophet vers he ha bungl now exclud mani respect christian i have met i have notic that while christ is thought to have ridden on ass the situat is often revers nowadai then enter the jerusalem templ the priest were anger at peopl and youngster call jesu the messiah but jesu repli as we might expect matthew to have done mt 21 16 haven t you read out of the mouth of babe and suckl thou ha brought perfect prais it is more like that matthew made thi respons up sinc jesu wa never on to point out such littl prophet thing and sinc as we might expect the quot is in error which seem to fit matthew s track record quit well we might ask jesu or matthew haven t you read for the sourc read psalm 8 1 2 o yahweh our lord how majest is your name in the whole world you whose glori is chant abov the heaven by babe and infant you have found a bulwark against your foe to still the enemi and the aveng the passag hardli need comment there is no perfect prais spoken of in the psalm and what prais is there is given to g d not hi messiah king and not jesu as mention it seem to be just on more case of matthew s pen make up conveni prophet scriptur yhvh said to my lord jesu is said to have ask from whom the promis jewish messiah king is to be descend the jew agre it is king david but then jesu counter by quot psalm 110 the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemi under your feet taken at face valu jesu is deni the necess of david descent on assum he is in opposit to their answer of cours the christian answer is that he agre but is try to make some hidden point to reveal some mysteri about the divin natur of the messiah king it s tempt to believ thi if on is a christian and not interest in matter of investig but there ar problem in jesu s time the psalm wa thought to be about the messiah and it is easi to see why david might refer to the messiah as hi superior we need onli look at the scriptur about the messiah to see that he is expect to be a great king bring the jew to time even better than those under david s rule of cours the jew listen had no good answer and the passag could inde refer to a divin messiah such as the christian worship the problem li in the mean of thi psalm an error that appar sever jew of jesu s time had also made on must rememb that there were variou faction among the jew often as a result of differ expect of the messiah king jesu wa appar on of these adventist like hi audienc who thought the messiah s advent wa immin and who interpret psalm 110 among other as be messian what is the problem then psalm 110 liter read yhvh s utter to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemi your footstool yhvh send forth your mighti scepter from zion rule in the midst of your foe your peopl will offer themselv freeli on the dai you lead your host on the holi mountain you ar a priest of the order of melchizedek forev the word lord is often mistakenli capitalis by christian bibl to denot divin in thi lord but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalis exist adoni simpli mean lord a gener term as we would us it it is us often in the scriptur to refer to king and to g d it is mere an address of respect there is noth in the text itself to impli that the word refer either to divin or to the messiah king that thi is suppos to be written by david is not certain the titl of the psalm translat to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david it seem fit to assum it to be written by a court poet about david s coven and endors from g d if the psalm had been written by david it is unlik that he would be talk about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descend from david wa not present in david s ag we have extens tale of david s do and sai none of which includ ani prais of a messiah mani of the psalm show evid of be written long after david wa dead in time of the exil when g d had put hi show of favour for david s kingdom on hold the descript in the psalm fit david veri well david wa promis by g d a rise to power victori over hi enemi success judgement among the nation he conquer he achiev the priesthood common to melchizedek in be a righteou king enabl to bless the peopl it all fit we do not have to blame thi problem on matthew alon though here there is not artifici propheci allud to though hi us of the scriptur is rather question still thi event is common to the other gospel too so we let matthew off a littl more easili thi time it is interest to note though how matthew dress up the event the earlier gospel of mark tell the tale with jesu simpli speak to a crowd matthew ha the pharise who becam the religi competit of an infant christian be the target of jesu s question as we might expect matthew write that the event end up by embarrass the pharise such power is the pen mose jesu had it togeth all along we leav the gospel stori of matthew momentarili to see a pseudo propheci in john s gospel the gospel stori of john deserv special treatment becaus it seem to be so far remov from the real event of jesu s career as told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at on vers the earli church leader found a religion on the jewish hope of a messiah king and on an artifici extens of the origin promis made by g d when construct the histori of abraham mose wrote of a promis of land and nationhood to the jewish peopl while thi wa accomplish eventu under the rule of king david the christian who came along later decid that thei would claim the fulfil of the promis but to do so thei expand on the promis preach about a heavenli kingdom john 8 56 j c speak your father abraham rejoic to see my dai he sai it and wa glad it would be nice to tie in approv for jesu from abraham but abraham knew noth of jesu or a messiah or anyth christian i have tri and fail to find ani event in the old testament which correspond to john s littl propheci it is par for the cours to see st john make up old testament back just like hi forerunn matthew mani christian know that their faith ha mani of it foundat in such fraud and it is surpris thei still cling to it the potter s field we ar told that jesu wa betrai while in jerusalem by on of hi follow juda iscariot matthew write mt 27 5 10 and throw down the piec of silver in the templ juda depart but the chief priest take the silver said it isn t law for us to put it in the treasuri sinc it is blood monei so thei bought a potter s field with it to buri stranger in then wa fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet jeremiah and thei took the thirti piec of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the son of israel and thei gave them for the potter s field as the lord direct me thi propheci is an utterli gross bastardis of old testament scriptur first matthew ha made a mistak regard the name of the prophet it is zechariah who utter the vers which matthew make us of zech 11 12 13 and thei weigh out my wage thirti shekel of silver then yhvh said to me cast them to the treasuri the lordli price at which i wa paid off by them so i took the thirti shekel of silver and cast them into the treasuri in the hous of yhvh first of all the vers of zechariah do not deal with a betray of the messiah or of g d the deal with a shepherd most like a priest chosen to serv a function of presid over the peopl shortli befor g d would send judah and israel into conflict with on anoth the word treasuri had been replac by the king jame scholar with to the potter precis becaus thi made matthew s quot fit better but thi is a blatant error the correct translat of the hebrew is inde treasuri which also make perfect sens in zechariah s context wherea potter s field is total unrel whether the mistransl wa intent or not seem to be beyond specul howev given matthew s track record on find it hard to resist the notion of intent dishonesti of cours matthew would have ampl reason for alter the text the thirti piec of silver match juda s situat and if as most christian seem to be the reader is will to disregard the contextu incongru matthew might have anoth propheci to toss around howev the correct translat of zechariah directli contradict the situat with juda and the high priest the high priest would not put the monei in the treasuri the worthless shepherd of zechariah doe exactli the opposit of cours to the averag thursdai night bibl student the propheci as present by matthew would be taken at new testament face valu to those matthew s work is convinc enough wine vinegar cast lot then jesu is led awai to be crucifi mt 27 34 35 thei gave him vinegar to drink mingl with gall but when he tast it he would not drink it and when thei had crucifi him thei divid hi garment among them by cast lot that it might be fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet thei part my garment among them and upon my vestur did thei cast lot first of all the vinegar offer to jesu is actual common sour wine of the type that roman soldier drank regularli we find that right befor jesu di the soldier themselv give him some to drink not pollut with gall jn 19 28 30 jesu said i thirst a bowl of vinegar stood there so thei put a spong full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to hi mouth when he had receiv the vinegar he said it is finish but matthew seem to be draw on not a passag from the prophet but on from the psalm ps 69 20 28 i look for piti but there wa none and for comfort but i found none thei gave me poison for food lit thei put gall in my meat and for my thirst thei gave me vinegar to drink add to them punish upon punish mai thei have no acquitt from thee let them be blot out of the book of the live of cours the sour wine offer to jesu is done at hi request of drink thi doe inde seem to be a show of piti the psalm quot is about david and hi polit and militari enemi it is not about the messiah or jesu it is then not surpris that we run into further problem when we see that the jesu in the psalm ask g d for the damnat of the crucifi wherea the jesu of the gospel sai lk 23 34 jesu said father forgiv them the don t know what thei do further matthew miss with hi attempt to creat propheci by have gall a bitter substanc put into jesu s drink not hi meat as the psalm stipul with the propheci of the vinegar faulti we natur ask what of the cast of lot thi bring up the 22nd psalm which deserv discuss all by itself suffic it now to sai that the fact that jesu s cloth were divid as told is no great thing it turn out that thi happen often to ani felon in those dai as we will soon see it is perhap the least erron passag of the psalm when appli to jesu it doe inde bring up the interest question as to the qualiti of jesu s cloth for a man so remov from worldli possess hi ownership of cloth worthi of cast lot rais some suspicion the 22nd psalm thi psalm is attribut to david as a lament of hi condit under the attack of hi enemi it becom a song of prais to yhvh and of hope taken out of context part of it seem to fit the plight of jesu at the crucifixion quit well we will examin the primari passag vers 1 2 my god my god why have you forsaken me why ar you so far from help me far from the word of my groan oh my god i cry by dai but you don t answer and by night but find no rest jesu is said to have cri the first sentenc while on the cross thi suggest that the whole psalm is realli about jesu rather than king david of cours the rest of the first stanza doe not fit as nice to jesu or hi execut jesu is not pictur as complain about the whole ordeal he is suppos to be like the lamb led mute befor it shearer inde jesu doesn t do much groan even when on the cross he certainli doe not cry by both dai and night on the cross 6 8 but i am a worm and no man scorn by men all who see me mock at me thei make face and wag their head he commit hi caus to yhvh so let him deliv him for he delight in him thi seem to fit jesu s execut pretti well with the except of the holi messiah be call a worm 12 13 mani bull encompass me thei open their mouth wide at me like a raven and roar lion 16 18 yea dog ar round about me a compani of evildo encir cle me thei have pierc my hand and feet i can see all my bone thei divid my garment among them and cast lost for my raiment 19 21 but you yhvh be not far awai deliv my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull it would seem quit convinc and i m sure the earli christian father who wrote of thi propheci thought so too unfortun thi propheci ha a fatal flaw the word have pierc realli do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translat is 16 yea dog ar round about me a compani of evildo encircl me like the lion thei ar at my hand and feet in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a veri rare verb form which can mean pierc differ by on phonet charact the word in the hebrew text is liter like the lion ka ari which make sens in the context and even further fit the anim imageri emploi by the psalm writer it is conveni that would urg a christian to chang the word to ka aru but to add the need yet artifici weight to the propheci thi is just what the christian translat have chosen to do while the correct translat doe not elimin the psalm from refer to jesu it absenc doe not sai much for the honesti of the translat apart from the erron vers 16 the psalm doe not lend itself to jesu so easili vers 20 speak of the suffer be save from a sword rather than a cross thi natur fit the psalm s true subject king david as a side note we now know that crucifixion did not pierc the hand the palm but rather the forearm thi doesn t sai much in favour of the tradit thought of a resurrect jesu show hi discipl the scar on hi palm but then fact aren t bound by our religi belief matthew escap culpabl thi time as he doe not attempt to draw mani direct link between thi psalm and hi lord jesu but the psalm like mani other wa on the mind of all the gospel writer when thei compil the stori and interpret of jesu s life and death how much these scriptur mai have contribut to what actual got written down is a question that ha seriou repercuss for christian theologi it is easi to see for those who ar not faith fundamentalist how some of the event in the new testament might have been enhanc by scribe such as the eager matthew but it doe less to specul than to simpli investig scriptur matter and prophet claim so far thi ha not said good thing for st matthew the refer to the pierc look a lot like jesu s crucifixion john s gospel recount written about 70 year after the fact tell us at jesu s execut jn 19 34 37 but on of the soldier pierc hi side with a spear and out came blood and water these thing took place that scriptur be fulfil the will look on him whom thei ve pierc of cours thi is built on a passag taken blatantli out of context prophet zechariah tell us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc 12 7 10 and yhvh will give victori to judah and on that dai i will seek to destroi the nation that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compass and supplic on jerusalem so that when thei look on him who thei have pierc thei will mourn and weep bitterli over him like you weep over a firstborn child john s attempt to make up propheci is perhap weaker that matthew s attempt matthew at least usual excontext more than just on passag john s error ar grossli obviou and blatant here it doe not speak well for ani of the gospel writer as it help to show how the prophet aspect of their religion were found reckon with transgressor after hi arrest jesu is quickli execut for claim the jewish kingship messiahship accord to on version of the gospel tale jesu get execut along with two thiev mk 15 27 and with him thei crucifi two robber on on hi right on on hi left and so the scriptur wa fulfil which sai he wa reckon with the transgressor here mark is try to link jesu to a passag in isaiah 53 about the servant nation of israel the passag is not about the messiah for if on read the whole chapter of isaiah 53 and it surround chapter on see that the servant is a nation the vers ar also about what thi servant ha gone through in the past not a predict of what is to come in ani event the servant is thought of as a crimin thi also happen to fit the descript of jesu had the passag realli been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why execut jesu between two thiev would fulfil the propheci in isaiah jesu would more fittingli fulfil it with hi whole ministri he wa consid a blasphem and troublemak all throughout hi career lock onto a singl event is a rather poor wai to steal propheci at least in thi case as we see that mark could have had made a better analog with gener comparison mark goe on to tell us how those who were crucifi with jesu also revil him 15 32 thi is to be expect from a coupl of robber of cours in hi later recount st luke decid to chang some thing luke tell us lk 23 39 43 and on of the crimin who wa hang with him rail aren t you the messiah save yourself and us thi certainli fit with mark s recount which tell how the peopl who crucifi jesu said save yourself and that the robber did the same but then luke goe on but the other crimin rebuk the first sai don t you fear g d sinc you ar under the same sentenc of condemn and we inde justli so for we ar receiv the due reward for our deed but thi man ha done noth wrong and he said jesu rememb me when you come in your kingdom and jesu answer verili i sai to you todai you will be with me in paradis now thi littl dialogu seem highli contriv it stretch the imagin a bit to see thi pictur of on ruffian rebuk hi fellow crimin with such eloqu speech we have a rather strang pictur of a crimin lament over the good of hi punish and the just of hi suffer such a man appar nobl and of principl doesn t seem like to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatric creat by luke of cours luke s recount also disagre with mark s luke ha onli on crimin revil jesu not both it is easi enough to discount the discrep becaus the account wa made up but those who wish to believ it is all part of the error free word of g d do not have thi avenu open thi is yet anoth exampl of a writer try to take an old testament passag and expand it and reinterpret it to suit hi theologi in thi case the embroideri creat some embarrass problem as we have seen the end of the world mt 24 now come perhap on of the most extraordinari and embarrass passag in the new testament it is found in all three of the synopt gospel stori and cast some of the most unfavour doubt on the whole theori of christian jesu mention the destruct of the jewish templ and build and hi discipl ask him about thi and about the end of the world which he ha been warn about the discipl tell us when will thi the templ s destruct be and what will be the sign of your come and of the close of the ag jesu take care that no on lead you astrai for mani will come in my name sai i am the christ you will hear of war and rumour of war for thi must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all thi is but the begin of the birthpang thei will deliv you up put you to death and fals prophet will aris and lead mani astrai but he who endur to the end will be save thi gospel will be preach throughout the whole world a testimoni to the nation and then the end will come so when you see the desol spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who ar in judea flee to the mountain immedi after the tribul of those dai the sun will be darken the star will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribe of the earth will mourn and see the son of man come and he will send out hi angel and gather hi elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as it branch becom tender and put forth leav you know that summer is near so also when you see all these thing you will know that he is near at the veri gate truli i sai to you thi gener will not pass awai until all these thing take place but of the dai and hour no on know not the angel not the son but onli the father therefor you also must be readi for the son of man is come at an hour you do not expect from thi it is clear that jesu thought the world would in within the lifetim of at least some of hi discipl he tell them that although he doesn t know the exact dai or hour that it will come and thu thei must be readi theologian have wet their pant in panic to find some wai out of thi holi error but unfortun jesu made himself to explicit he told hi discipl that their gener would still be around at the end and that thei in particular should prepar for it prepar to be swept awai there have been some who resort to remov the inerr natur of the bibl and said that the phrase thi gener shall not pass awai realli mean thi race of peopl will not pass awai of cours the word for gener is us mani time to refer to exactli that the gener of the discipl it is an interest notion that when god decid to learn greek he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quit obviou from the rest of the dialogu that the discipl at least some of them ar suppos to live to the end of the world the charg of mistransl is complet blown awai by look at the apostl respons it becom abundantli clear from rev 22 7 1 peter 4 7 1 john 2 18 and rev 22 20 that jesu meant exactli what he said the end wa veri near for 2 000 year christian have rationalis thi 24th chapter of matthew or ignor it mean altogeth for 2 000 year thei have wait for their execut leader to come back hear of war and rumour of war sure that he is come soon sure he must be all we must do is wait can you imagin how tire he must be sit around up there be holi wait for just the right moment to spring so shortli after hi crucifixion jesu of nazareth joshua ben joseph di it is said that after three dai or three dai and three night or three period of time or three etern second or three of whatev thei can decid make for less troubl he wa seen again resurrect glow with divin radianc then the saviour decid it wasn t in the best interest of hi new religion to stick around and therefor disappear from sight into heaven so the stori goe anywai as ha been seen there were mani thing attribut to jesu when peopl got around to write the gospel stori down to them jesu wa the fulfil of all propheci and scriptur we have seen though that thi matter is quit shaki but throughout church histori christian have held fast to faith in simpl belief what doctrin object could not be solv with argument or brute forc faith and forget kept awai from question to question and investig ha never been the easiest wai to treat matter thu for 2 000 year the propheci cite in the new testament have gone on larg accept thing mai well continu that wai for some time paus a moment to consid the wai the doctrin of christian have been accept and us properli or improperli to support war and persecut i suppos there is on propheci of which christian can secur keep hold mt 10 34 jesu don t think that i have come to bring peac on earth i haven t come to bring peac but rather a sword
