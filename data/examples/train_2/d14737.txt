jerryl payn write to sublim a cultur for the sake of what you perceiv as uniti seem antithet to the veri messag of inclus that you preach i agre with the except that i don t preach ignor our cultur the bodi as a whole must be unifi the question is shall we be a melt pot boil ourselv down to on legitim express or shall we be more like a stew maintain the textur integr of the express divers while uphold the uniti of thought it releas all church from the us of the latin mass uniti to allow them to speak to the peopl in the common languag divers in revel 2 3 we see that in the first centuri church there wa on congreg in each major citi so there wa on unifi church now in each citi there were peopl of differ cultur natur thei form someth of a stew with differ member have differ heritag nevertheless thei were on bodi thei met togeth sometim as smaller group in their home and sometim in bigger group in place such as the templ court now in a particular citi then and now you will find that there is a common languag associ with that region for instanc in rome latin wa spoken in the unit state todai english is spoken so it would make sens that congreg in differ citi would speak the common languag and not necessarili latin natur you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common languag in the first centuri church there were probabl mani peopl in the congreg who could speak a given tongu to translat the messag for peopl of foreign ethnic group todai howev you don t see peopl speak in tongu to translat sermon even in so call pentacost church we do have a modern dai equival though bi lingual speaker now in the unifi church of which i am a member sometim call the intern church of christ when we all meet togeth on sundai there ar headphon on peopl who don t speak english from which thei hear an ongo translat of the sermon in their nativ tongu neat idea huh now we meet in differ size group in a random sort of wai on sundai so sometim there will be a meet of onli haitian or of spanish speak peopl for exampl who will hear an evangelist preach in their nativ languag in addit we meet in small group a coupl of time dure the week for bibl discuss group and devot so someon who speak a differ languag will almost alwai be with peopl who also speak hi languag assum the congreg is larg enough for those meet as for the peopl who speak the common languag thei can keep in touch with their cultur if thei want but thei will also have equal deep friendship among their church relationship with peopl of mani variou nation ha the purpos of the church been thwart by thi action the action of let cathol worship in a nativ languag instead of latin inde not see my second paragraph in respons to the second clip of your articl howev if you mean the action of form denomin base on a cultur then the purpos of the church ha been inde thwart i ll assum the second possiblil when answer your next clip rather i believ it ha been enhanc for paul exhort us to becom as on of them that we might reach them thu if a person or group of peopl feel more comfort among their own shall we not give them a place where thei can feel comfort with their heritag and still l ov god my guess aaron you have met some need of peopl certainli by help them to be proud of their cultur heritag when most denomin didn t yet you have larg isol yourselv from have qualiti christian friendship outsid your nation and your denomin we shall certainli give peopl a place to feel comfort with their heritag howev we will do thi in a wai that doe not destroi church uniti but rather encourag friendship among all discipl thi is the approach of some of the group that you cite it sound like these group have wonder intent but thei ar go about thing in the wrong wai and name like the african methodist episcop church still make me cring although not as much as befor i understand that there wa more racism in the past that caus such group to be form but now we should try to unit i know that it s hard for mani peopl on thi newsgroup to imagin there be onli on bodi of peopl on earth but it is quit possibl and i am work to make it happen howev what might be a smaller step toward uniti would be take the word african out of your denomin s name then perhap somedai a long time off you can also remov the methodist episcop part also and simpli be part of the church with regard to inclus i note tht your sig emit from mit as you know the tute is religi and cultur diversifi and not everyon who come there is immedi comfort with english much less american cultur what shall be the conduct of the campu church then shall there be on church for the sake of uniti or shall the organ like kcf be us in help student new to america make the transit in cultur languag and thought there shall be on church for the sake of uniti and it shall be us in help student new to america make the transit in cultur languag and thought we shouldn t make a new denomin to try to solv problem the whole denomin mindset onli caus more problem sadli in the am church we retain african cutlur at the root of our express but we ar by no mean exclus sinc you live in cambridg i invit you to visit the
