in articl 1qsfak$skc network ucsd edu doug p book dpb sdchemw2 ucsd edu write hi i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra 900 but i am not total sure becaus my roomat ha the same problem on hi powerbook 170 ani info or experi anyopn ha would be greatli appreci when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system the follow type of sound mono as far as i can tell all plai fine through both speaker system beep alreadi provid on such as indigo and on i record armor allei spectr spaceward ho but the follow game onli plai out of the left channel lem out of thi world awesom game btw glider 4 0 oid but still stereo system beep do plai in stereo through both speaker the on i m specif referr to is apocolypt begin which my roommat download from some ftp site sumex all of the symptom ar the same on my rommat 170 he can t run ootw becaus he doesn t have color we re both run system 7 1 doe anyon with lem or the other three game i mention abov get sound out of both speaker on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook 140 or greater centri se 30 etc stereo machin i us to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeb lem plai in stereo on that machin not just on the left channel i could be mistaken though if there were a problem with the quad 900 s and pb 170 s i am wonder why the system beep still plai in stereo if there isn t a problem with our machin i wonder why the 4 game abov ar apparantli written to support onli on channel of stereo when thei could just us mono sound so the mono sound would at least come out of both speaker like spectr etc do quadra 900 s and powerbook 170 s have the same rom to my knowledg so mayb thi is a rom problem if so though why wouldn t system 7 1 patch over thi problem thank for ani help you can provid in articl 1993apr18 213827 9974 kth se jon wtte d88 jwa hemul nada kth se write mac sound hardwar is divers some mac plai in stereo and mix the output the se 30 for instanc while other plai in stereo but onli ha the left channel for the speaker while some ar truli mono like the lc develop know that stuff plai in the left channel is guarante to be heard while the right channel isn t some send data to both some onli send data to the left channel the first is preferr of cours okai i guess it time for a quick explan of mac sound the origin document for the sound hardwar im 3 document how to make sound by directli access hardwar basic you jam valu into all the even byte from soundbas to soundbas 0x170 thi wa becaus of how the mac 128 and some later machin gener sound wa by scan thi block and d a everi even byte the odd byte went to the floppi on some machin when the mac ii and appl sound chip wa invent it wa design to gener stereo sound it wa also design to be compat with we had onc document so store byte at the even valu at soundbas meant i want to plai a mono sound and so it wa emul but appl had sinc retract the document on soundbas and decid not to document the lowest layer of sound gener so appl never explain where to stuff byte if you want to make stereo sound enter game develop the sound driver and current sound manag ar inconveni lame for make game furthermor peopl who port from the ibm don t want to learn more api so it ha becom popular for game writer to write to soundbas to make sound sinc it is veri easi sinc the mac ii appl ha had mani differ kind of sound output hardwar and the onli thing thei have in common ar that write to soundbas work on some hardwar mac ii iix iicx iici at least write to soundbas get you mono sound through both speaker on some mac quadra 700 900 950 at least write to soundbas get you mono sound on the left channel onli both ar technic correct interpret of the origin specif but on is obvious prefer for asthet reason if develop us the sound manag and i think the sound driver mono sound will typic come out through both channel regardless of the underli hardwar it is possibl to specifi you want to gener left channel onli but no on doe if develop write to sound base their game will onli come out the left on some game the other problem the origin mac ii onli produc left channel sound on the intern speaker while the se 30 mix both isn t realli relat it is due to the post gener amplif us on the motherboard of the differ machin it onli affect true stereo sound sound which ar actual mono will plai on the intern speaker no matter what machin you have now to more directli address the question the game you list lem out of thi world awesom game btw glider 4 0 oid and also hellcat super tetri oxyd and mani more these ar just what i ve test cheat and write to soundbas and so ar onli left channel on quadra other game you list armor allei spectr spaceward ho and also pga tour golf civil and more these ar again onli from person experi us the sound manag and work fine on all machin the more of the stori is to develop don t cheat realli i am absolut posit not allow to do what i am about to do but i m go sai it anywai stop cheat on sound realli soon you will be sorri as even those without extern speaker will be disappoint with your sound on futur hardwar the grace period is about to end the sound manag is understand now and work pretti well and will work even better soon so us it in conclus to doug it isn t a hardwar problem at least not a bug to jon it isn t a choic to develop as to whether thei want to send sound to both channel if thei do it the right wai it is taken care of automat if you cheat there is not wai to make it work on all hardwar have fun disclaim number 1 i don t work on sound here at appl i m just pretti well inform so don t write me with sound question disclaim number 2 if it sai up abov that i wrote anyth like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your new feed sinc i am catagor not allow to sai anyth like that you know what i mean disclaim number 3 i don t speak for appl just me steve bolling
