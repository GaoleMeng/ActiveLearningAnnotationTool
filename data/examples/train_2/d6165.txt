i have been post monthli how to setup a slip client on a pc post for a few month lot of work and immin graduat have come in the wai of post on of these for march or earlier thi month for which i apolog thi file includ inform on write a script for univers of minnesota phone and also a batch file hack that let you us other packet driver with phone for addit modif and correct i can be reach at ashok biochemistri cwru edu best wish ashok begin slip txt base on my experi on set up slip under do and window here ar my comment on set up slip in thi environ i thank the trumpet beta tester and the cwru slip beta tester for their comment configur your modem a turn off dtr at d0 w i have to disabl dtr becaus the commun program that i us to dial my slip server qmodem drop dtr when i exit the program and therefor hang up the line if you us a program like kermit or conex to establish the slip connect then thi need not be done these program do not necessarili hangup the line when you exit note if you us univ of minn phone to dial and establish a slip connect you do not need to turn off dtr b dial and establish the slip connect first thi can be done automat if you us a program like phone from the univers of minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connect then load the slip packet driver the phone script languag is simpl and phone script can be easili written to configur phone to work with other slip server in addit while the onli packet driver that phone work with is umslip current it is easi to write a batch file hack that let phone work with other packet driver there is a section on phone in the document with both script and batch file exampl configur the slip driver there ar five slip packet driver commonli avail cslipper ex peter tattam s compress slip driver slipper ex peter tattam s slip driver slip8250 com crynwr driver i like phil burn s modifi driver ethersl com crynwr driver ethernet simul over slip umslip com univ of minnesota driver base on slip8250 of these four i vastli prefer c slipper ex over slip8250 com or ethersl com for the follow reason a it is much faster even though my modem ha just a 16450 uart b while us etherslip slip8250 umslip myself and sever other have notic that the pc clock get mess up after perform a long ftp transfer c it support pktmux when us in ethernet simul mode d when us in ethernet simul mode c slipper seem to work with everi tcp ip applic that i have test it with instruct for c slipper ex and you do not us phone a load slipper in your autoexec bat file accord to instruct for instanc if you have a v 32bi modem on com1 slipper com1 vec 62 baud 57600 b if you us do tcp ip applic in win 3 1 do box then us the doubl end packet driver shim winpkt com thi creat a virtual packet driver at 0x60 do applic in nativ mode do applic in window 3 1 do box and window applic can all us thi virtual driver at 0x60 winpkt com 0x60 0x62 c if you us qvt net load pktint com next qvt net is configur in qvtnet ini to us the interrupt at 0x60 pktint com instruct for slip8250 com a try get a version 10 slip driver philip burn of northwestern univers ha a modifi slip8250 com driver that is better at hardwar handshak thi driver is distribut along with nupop b load the driver after establish the slip connect my modem is a v 32bi modem on com1 so here is how i would load the driver slip8250 w 0x62 h 4 slip 0x03f8 57600 c as discuss abov if you us do tcp ip applic in window 3 x do box you probabl want to us winpkt com winpkt com 0x60 0x62 d if you us winqvt net load pktint com pktint com instruct for ethersl com if you choos to us ethersl com instead of slip8250 com the instruct ar exactli the same with on crucial differ you will have to delet the line devic vcd from the 386enh section of system ini thi will interfer with run regular window comm applic such as crosstalk and you will get lot of drop charact etc in these applic thi is therefor not recommend etherslip would be load as ethersl w 0x62 h 4 0x03f8 57600 configur window 3 1 a make the follow modif to the system ini file 386enh section i list all your com port with their address and interrupt com1base 03f8 com1irq 4 com2base 02f8 com2irq 3 com3base 03e8 com3irq 5 thi can also be done from within window control panel but doubl click on the port icon ii give the port to which your modem is attach a gener com buffer com1buffer 10000 iii chang the com port autoassign valu for the com port that you wish to us for your modem to zero thi is the amount of time that window wait in second befor hand control of that com port to anoth applic if you us winqvt net and then want to switch from on session to anoth and thi valu is at the default valu of 2 second you ar will get a gpf and window will crash com1autoassign 0 thi can also be done from within window control panel doubl click on 386 enhanc and under devic content set the devic content for the com port your modem is on to never warn addit note what to do if you ar assign a differ ip address for each slip session i am fortun in that our campu slip server assign each user a perman ip address so i do not have worri about edit qvtnet ini each time that i establish a slip connect if you ar assign a new ip address on everi occas that you dial in pleas try to us bootp awar softwar and let bootp do the configur for you howev qvtnet is not bootp awar and rarp will not work over a slip connect to get qvtnet work in a situat such as thi you must do the follow edit the qvtnet ini file let the net section look like thi net name ip netmask 255 255 255 0 or whatev is appropri for you arptim 20 packet_vector 60 or whatev is appropri save the chang and then write protect thi file attrib r qvtnet ini start your slip connect and rememb the name and ip address that you ar assign each time you start qvt net 3 1x the gener configur dialog box will open enter the name and ip address and you were assign for that session click on ok and you should be up and run the chang you make will not be save as qvtnet ini is write protect a more eleg solut to the problem of dynam slip ip address assign is provid by victor menayang victor ccwf cc utexa edu victor us the program bootpq to semi autom qvtnet prepar bootpq is us to inquir the assign ip which is then save to a file call myip anoth file noip is essenti a complet qvtnet ini file that lack the ip address in the final step myip and noip ar copi into a singl qvtnet ini file an exampl of victor s batch file is provid below slipper com2 pktint com bootpq i ip %%s myip bootpq i my ip is %s copi q net myip noip e com qvtnet qvtnet ini del q myip echo off echo echo readi to run winqvtnet for question and more detail about bootpq pleas contact victor menayang victor ccwf cc utexa edu qpc softwar is attempt to add bootp capabl to winqvt net how do you us pktmux over slip pktmux will not work over the slip8250 com packet driver and crash immedi if us with ethersl com pktmux will work with c slipper ex when c slipper is us in ethernet simul mode an exampl of thi configur is shown below the latest releas of pktmux is 1 2c and it is import that you us thi version if you want to us virtual packet driver with applic like trumpet for window to be releas veri shortli from autoexec bat lh c slipper com1 vec 65 baud 57600 ether packet driver lh pktmux 5 65 5 pktmux load for 5 virtual packet driver lh pktdrv 7f 65 first virtual packet driver us for qvt net lh pktint com qvt net pktint com pktdrv 63 65 pktdrv for us in nativ do or wintrumpet addit virtual packet driver can be load directli from within window 3 1 do box for exampl my pif file to load popmail is direct to the file popmail bat thi is what popmail bat read like pktdrv 60 65 load a virtual packet driver at 0x60 cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv 60 u unload the packet driver at 0x60 exit caus the do window to close i have similar batch file that load other do tcp ip applic like pc gopher it is my experi that pktmux work fine even if the virtual packet driver in two independ virtual do session ar load at the same softwar interrupt for exampl within two differ do box on for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is load at 0x60 in each instanc how much doe pktmux degrad the perform of c slipper i have a v 32bi v 42bi modem in a 386 33 run window 3 1 with a reason fast video card ati graphic ultra under these condit when i have three virtual packet driver load and be us as follow a driver at 0x7f qvtnet ftp client session b driver at 0x60 in on do window cutcp tn3270 session c driver at 0x60 in anoth do window trumpet for do i get ftp transfer rate of 0 8 1 0 kb sec while transfer compress file thi rate is compar to that which i get with slip8250 load as a packet driver and where a singl tcp ip session is activ if cslipper is us a packet driver and a singl session is activ i get transfer rate of 1 3 1 4 kb sec on the same file while there is about 40% degrad in the perform of slipper for me the benefit of be abl to us pktmux outweigh the perform hit c slipper and ethernet simul mode in ethernet simul mode c slipper ver 1 3 work with all the applic that i have test it with on or two applic that requir ethernet simul balk at c slipper 1 2 but even these rare problem have been resolv with ver 1 3 when slipper is us in ethernet simul mode and us with pktmux i get some an error messag in the qvtnet consol window that read ip incorrect packet type or ip bad version number thi doe not seem to prevent qvtnet from function although i cannot comment on loss of perform what can you do if your do tcp ip applic doe not work with c slipper in ethernet simul mode in the rare event that you find a packag that doe not work with c slipper in ethernet simul mode first contact the author peter tattam peter psychnet psychol uta edu au and let him know chanc ar that he can fix it in the meanwhil you can try the follow i do not know if it is kosher but it work when i had problem with c slipper ver 1 2 c slipper is load at 0x62 as describ abov under the pktmux section i load ethersl com at 0x60 run the applic and then termin ethersl com thi also work within window 3 1 virtual do box howev a packet driver like ethersl can be us in onli on virtual do box at a time so for exampl here is my batch file to run grate med a medic refer retriev program develop at the nation librari of medicin ethersl w 0x60 h 4 0x03f8 57600 load etherslip cd gm6 search cd termin 0x60 termin etherslip exit close the do box and return me to window if you us thi method be cautiou about on thing don t have ani activ pktmux do session open at the same time after close the ethersl window you can run your pktmux do session with no problem btw the exampl abov grate med work with no problem with c slipper ver 1 3 phone script file the document that accompani phone provid good instruct on write script file to get phone to dial slip server other than the univers of minnesota server for exampl here is a script that i us to dial a cisco server at the univers that i attend background to start a slip connect i dial our termin server and login with a usernam and password after do so i start a
