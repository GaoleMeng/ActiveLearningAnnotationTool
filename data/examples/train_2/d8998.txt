dyoung media mit edu david young write i have an applicationshel which us a colormap creat with xcreatecolormap and us all of the color avail for my 8 bit displai when i popup a dialogshel to prompt the user for some input i want the xmndialogstyl to be set to xmdialog_primari_applic_modal the result is that if my cursor is over the dialogshel i get my colormap but if the cursor is over the applicationshel or ani window other than the dialogshel i get the default colormap but i d like it so that if my cursor is over _ani_ window of my applic i get my colormap i think thi is correct behavior rememb the default colormapfocuspolici is keyboard mean the cmap focu follow the keyboard focu sinc the dialog is modal mwm won t allow keyboard focu onto your main shell and so it won t allow cmap focu either sinc it sound as though you have keyboardfocuspolici pointer i suggest you set colormapfocuspolici pointer also that wai the cmap focu won t slavishli follow keyboard focu but will beat it own path if you have keyboardfocuspolici explicit you can set cmap focu explicit also but you then need a bind to f focu_color probabl on mb1 david brook
