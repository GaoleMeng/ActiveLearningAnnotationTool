sci space reader can skip the first paragraph yesterdai in respons to henri spencer s question about the temperatur of a blackbodi in interstellar space i said dust grain act as blackbodi and thei re at 40 150 k well i wa dead wrong our local interstellar dust expert bruce drain ha inform me that dust grain _aren t_ good radiat in the far ir which is why thei ar so warm actual the ambient radiat field from distant star can bring a true blackbodi to onli 3 or 4 kelvin sorri henri and anyon els i misl obvious time for me to take anoth ism class in other new alan stern of the southwest research institut gave a talk on the pluto charon binari system yesterdai he gave a brief overview of the current accept system paramet volum ratio of about 8 1 mass ratio about 15 1 or so plu lot more and then gave hi thought on the format of pluto charon hi idea is that there were lot and lot of small planetesim in the outer solar system with mass distribut as a power law of some kind over time the planetesim accret into larger bodi most got scatter out of the solar system by close encount with jupit and saturn but mani accret into the ga giant especi uranu and neptun a larg planetesim wa captur by neptun we call it triton captur how perhap by a collis with a smaller alreadi exist neptunian moon perhap by a veri close passag through neptun s atmospher mondo aerobrak he note that the two recent discov kuiper belt object 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw plu chiron and pholu ar all about the same mass and he identifi thi group as on accret down from the larger bodi of triton and pluto charon pluto charon he think form when an impact bodi hit proto pluto knock some materi into a ring around pluto which later accret in charon similar to idea about the format of earth s moon there is good evid from spectra that the surfac of pluto and charon ar veri differ pluto ha methan frost charon doesn t which can be us as evid for the impact theori he believ that there mai be around 1000 pluto to chiron size object remain in a rel stabl dynam zone just outsid neptun s orbit beyond 35 au or so 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw ar the first member of thi popul to be found in hi model note that such bodi will be veri dark sinc if their surfac ar cover with methan frost it will have photolyz into veri dark long chain hydrocarbon by now the reason that pluto ha such a high albedo around 0 5 i think is that it surfac warm up just enough around perihelion to sublim and when the atmospher freez out again thirti year later it form bright new frost so ani bodi much farther awai than 30 au ar go to be veri hard to see i hope i haven t made ani error in the transcript if you see a howl mistak it s undoubtedli mine not hi by the wai he s on of the top gun behind the pluto fast flybi mission i think and said that the current plan ar to us a titan 4 to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectori to pluto we were speak loos at the time he d like to us a proton which give a slightli smaller veloc but cost much less hi figur $500 million for 2 titan 4 launch there will be two separ probe launch separ or $120 million for 2 proton launch he told a stori about how the soviet origin offer to sell proton launch for $30 million each but were forc to increas their price in the us in order to be allow in the marketplac i m just tell you what he said michael michael richmond thi is the heart that broke my finger richmond astro princeton edu
