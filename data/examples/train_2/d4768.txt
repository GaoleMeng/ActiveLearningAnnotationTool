from us as well as a huge user contribut librari featur descript hip is a set of imag process modul which togeth provid a power suit of tool for those interest in research system develop and teach it handl sequenc of imag movi in precis the same manner as singl frame program and subroutin have been develop for simpl imag transform filter convolut fourier and other transform process edg detect and line draw manipul digit imag compress and transmiss method nois gener and imag statist comput over 150 such imag transform program have been develop as a result almost ani imag process task can be perform quickli and conveni addition hip allow user to easili integr their own custom routin new user becom effect us hip on their first dai hip featur imag that ar self document each imag store in the system contain a histori of the transform that have been appli to that imag hip includ a small set of subroutin which primarili deal with a standard imag sequenc header and a larg librari of imag transform tool in the form of unix filter it come complet with sourc code on line manual page and on line document host configur requir origin develop at new york univers hip now repres on of the most extens and flexibl vision and imag process environ current avail it run under the unix oper system it is modular and flexibl provid automat document of it action and is almost entir independ of

lexidata macintosh ii x window system and iri the hipsaddon packag includ an interfac for the cr 4000 it is a simpl matter to interfac hip with other frame store and we can put interest user in touch with user who have interfac hip with the arlunya and datacub max video hip can be easili adapt for other imag displai devic becaus 98% of hip is machin independ avail hip ha proven itself a highli flexibl system both as an interact research tool and for more product orient task it is both easi to us and quickli adapt and extend to new us hip is suppli on magnet tape in unix tar format either
