the follow document summar the clipper chip how it is us how program of the chip is coupl to kei gener and the escrow process and how law enforc decrypt commun sinc there ha been some specul on thi new group about my own involv in thi project i d like to add that i wa not in ani wai involv i found out about it when the fbi brief me on thursdai even april 15 sinc then i have spent consider time talk with the nsa and fbi to learn more about thi and i attend the nist brief at the depart of commerc on april 16 the document below is the result of that effort dorothi den the clipper chip a technic summari dorothi den april 19 1993 introduct on april 16 the presid announc a new initi that will bring togeth the feder govern and industri in a voluntari program to provid secur commun while meet the legitim need of law enforc at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encrypt chip call the clipper chip togeth with a split kei approach to escrow kei two escrow agenc ar us and the kei part from both ar need to reconstruct a kei chip structur the clipper chip contain a classifi 64 bit block encrypt algorithm call skipjack the algorithm us 80 bit kei compar with 56 for the de and ha 32 round of scrambl compar with 16 for the de it support all 4 de mode of oper throughput is 16 mbit a second each chip includ the follow compon the skipjack encrypt algorithm f an 80 bit famili kei that is common to all chip n a 30 bit serial number u an 80 bit secret kei that unlock all messag encrypt with the chip encrypt with the chip to see how the chip is us imagin that it is embed in the at t telephon secur devic as it will be suppos i call someon and we both have such a devic after push a button to start a secur convers my secur devic will negoti a session kei k with the devic at the other end in gener ani method of kei exchang can be us the kei k and messag stream m i e digit voic ar then fed into the clipper chip to produc two valu e m k the encrypt messag stream and e e k u n f a law enforc block the law enforc block thu contain the session kei k encrypt under the unit kei u concaten with the serial number n all encrypt under the famili kei f chip program and escrow all clipper chip ar program insid a scif secur comput inform facil which is essenti a vault the scif contain a laptop comput and equip to program the chip about 300 chip ar program dure a singl session the scif is locat at mikotronx at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two kei escrow agenc enter the vault agent 1 enter an 80 bit valu s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enter an 80 bit valu s2 these valu serv as seed to gener kei for a sequenc of serial number to gener the unit kei for a serial number n the 30 bit valu n is first pad with a fix 34 bit block to produc a 64 bit block n1 s1 and s2 ar then us as kei to tripl encrypt n1 produc a 64 bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarli n is pad with two other 34 bit block to produc n2 and n3 and two addit 64 bit block r2 and r3 ar comput r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 ar then concaten togeth give 192 bit the first 80 bit ar assign to u1 and the second 80 bit to u2 the rest ar discard the unit kei u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 ar the kei part that ar separ escrow with the two escrow agenc as a sequenc of valu for u1 u2 and u ar gener thei ar written onto three separ floppi disk the first disk contain a file for each serial number that contain the correspond kei part u1 the second disk is similar but contain the u2 valu the third disk contain the unit kei u agent 1 take the first disk and agent 2 take the second disk the third disk is us to program the chip after the chip ar program all inform is discard from the vault and the agent leav the laptop mai be destroi for addit assur that no inform is left behind the protocol mai be chang slightli so that four peopl ar in the room instead of two the first two would provid the seed s1 and s2 and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agenc the escrow agenc have as yet to be determin but thei will not be the nsa cia fbi or ani other law enforc agenc on or both mai be independ from the govern law enforc us when law enforc ha been author to tap an encrypt line thei will first take the warrant to the servic provid in order to get access to the commun line let us assum that the tap is in place and that thei have determin that the line is encrypt with clipper thei will first decrypt the law enforc block with the famili kei f thi give them e k u n thei will then take a warrant identifi the chip serial number n to each of the kei escrow agent and get back u1 and u2 u1 and u2 ar xore togeth to produc the unit kei u and e k u is decrypt to get the session kei k final the messag stream is decrypt all thi will be accomplish through a special black box decod oper by the fbi acknowledg and distribut notic all inform is base on inform provid by nsa nist and the fbi permiss to distribut thi document is grant
