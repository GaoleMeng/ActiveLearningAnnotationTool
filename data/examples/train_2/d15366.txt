here is some materi by michael davi on the subject of schism in gener and archishop lefebvr in particular he wrote it around 1990 the first part of the two part articl wa on the scandal activ of archbishop weakland in thi countri but i cut all that and i pare down the rest to what wa relev joe buehler schism and disobedi accord to st thoma aquina schism consist primarili in a refus of submiss to the pope or communion with the member of the church unit to him on first sight it would appear that whatev the subject motiv of the archbishop as discuss abov he must be in a state of object schism as he ha refus to submit to the pope on a veri grave matter involv hi suprem power of jurisdict howev standard cathol textbook of theologi make it clear that while all schism involv disobedi not all act of disobedi ar schismat if thi were so as wa note at the begin of thi articl it would mean that the number of american bishop who ar not schismat would not reach doubl figur the distinct between disobedi and schism is made veri clear in the articl on schism in the veri authorit dictionnair de theologi catholiqu the articl is by father yve congar who is certainli no friend of archbishop lefebvr he explain that schism and disobedi ar so similar that thei ar often confus father congar write that schism involv a refus to accept the exist of legitim author in the church for exampl luther s reject of the papaci father congar explain that the refus to accept a decis of legitim author in a particular instanc doe not constitut schism but disobedi the cathol encyclopedia explain that for a cathol to be truli schismat he would have to intend to sever himself from the church as far as in him li it add that not everi disobedi is schism in order to possess thi charact it must includ besid the transgress of the command of the superior a denial of their divin right to command not onli doe mgr lefebvr not deni the divin right of the pope to command but he affirm repeatedli hi recognit of the pope s author and hi intent of never break awai from rome the archbishop made hi attitud clear in the juli august 1989 issu of 30 dai we prai for the pope everi dai noth ha chang with the consecr last june 30 we ar not sedevacantist we recogn in john paul ii the legitim pope of the cathol church we don t even sai that he is a heret pope we onli sai that hi modernist action favor heresi intrins schismat the princip argument us by those claim that mgr lefebvr is in schism is that the consecr of a bishop without a papal mandat is an intrins schismat act a bishop who carri out such a consecr it is claim becom ipso facto a schismat thi is not true if such a consecr is an intrins schismat act it would alwai have involv the penalti of excommun in the 1917 code of canon law the offenc wa punish onli by suspens see canon 2370 of the 1917 code pope piu xii had rais the penalti to excommun as a respons to the establish of a schismat church in china the consecr of these illicit chines bishop differ radic from the consecr carri out by mgr lefebvr as the profess intent wa to repudi the author of the pope that is to deni that he ha the right to govern the church and the illicitli consecr chines bishop were given a mandat to exercis an apostol mission neither archbishop lefebvr nor ani of the bishop he ha consecr claim that thei have power of jurisdict thei have been consecr sole for the purpos of ensur the surviv of the societi by carri out ordin and also to perform confirm i do not wish to minim in ani wai the graviti of the step take by mgr lefebvr the consecr of bishop without a papal mandat is far more seriou matter than the ordin of priest as it involv a refus in practic of the primaci or jurisdict belong by divin right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argu that the crisi afflict the church could not be more grave and that grave measur were need in respons it appear to be taken for grant by most of the archbishop s critic that he wa excommun for the offens of schism and the vatican ha certainli been guilti of foster thi impress there is not so much as a modicum of truth in thi alleg the new code of canon law includ a section begin with canon 1364 entitl penalti for specif offens de poeni in singula dicta the first part deal with offens against religion and the uniti of the church de delicti contra religionem et ecclesia unitatem canon 1364 deal with the offens of schism which is evid togeth with apostasi and heresi on of the three fundament offens against the uniti of the church but the archbishop wa not excommun under the term of thi canon or inde under ani canon involv an offens against religion or the uniti of the church the canon cite in hi excommun come from the third section of penalti for specif offens which is entitl usurp of ecclesi function and offens in their exercis de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpation degu delicti inii exercendi the canon in question is canon 1382 which read a bishop who consecr someon bishop and the person who receiv such a consecr from a bishop without a pontif mandat incur an automat lata sententia excommun reserv to the holi see the scandal attempt to smear archbishop lefebvr with the offens of schism ar then contrari to both truth and chariti a compar smear under civil as oppos to ecclesiast law would certainli justifi legal action for libel involv massiv damag an accur parallel would be to state that a man convict of manslaught had been convict of first degre murder i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubiou opinion of laymen unvers in the intricaci of canon law canon lawyer without the least shred of sympathi for mgr lefebvr have repudi the charg of schism made against him as total unten father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculti of canon law of the institut catholiqu in pari note in the 4 juli 1988 issu of valeur actuel that as i have just explain mgr lefebvr wa not excommun for schism but for the usurp of an ecclesiast function he ad that it is not the consecr of a bishop which constitut schism but the conferr of an apostol mission upon the illicitli consecr bishop it is thi usurp of the power of the sovereign pontiff which prove the intent of establish a parallel church cardin rosalio lara presid of the pontif commiss for the authent interpret of canon law comment on the consecr in the 10 juli 1988 issu of la repubblica it would be hard to imagin a more authorit opinion the cardin wrote the act of consecr a bishop without a papal mandat is not in itself a schismat act in fact the code that deal with offens is divid into two section on deal with offens against religion and the uniti of the church and these ar apostasi schism and heresi consecr a bishop with a pontif mandat is on the contrari an offens against the exercis of a specif ministri for exampl in the case of the consecr carri out by the vietnames archbishop ngo dinh thuc in 1976 and 1983 although the archbishop wa excommun he wa not consid to have commit a schismat act becaus there wa no intent of a breach with the church it is not simpli unjust but ludicr to suggest that in consecr bishop without a papal mandat archbishop lefebvr had the least intent of establish a schismat church he is not a schismat and will never be a schismat the archbishop consid correctli that the the church is undergo it worst crisi sinc the arian heresi and that for the good of the church it wa necessari for him to consecr the four bishop to ensur the futur of hi societi canon law provid for just such a situat and even if on believ that the futur of the societi could have been guarante without these consecr the fact that the archbishop believ sincer that it could not mean as canon law state clearli that he ha not incur excommun furthermor while the vatican allow such prelat as archbishop weakland to undermin the faith with impun it cannot expect cathol to pai the least attent to it sanction against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entir life ha been devot to the servic of the church and the salvat of soul dr eric m de saventhem presid of the intern una voce associ is on of the best inform laymen in the church and he know the archbishop intim dr
