in articl c5jzz7 9g7 panix com ml panix com michael siemon write well the whole point of make these the base command is that thei aren t reduc to rule a set of rule is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be veri help to individu or societi but not if thei ar us instead of a person involv in and respons for on s action the two command ar rule thei ar mere rule that ar so vagu that thei ar practic devoid of mean michael siemon acknowledg thi everi time he write that the resolut of an argument over them turn on secular and cultur assumpt that ar independ of these rule the great command is more than anyth els a call to act as if you were god and accept ultim respons in your everi action the command to love your neighbor as yourself can be view in part as remind man that he is not god and cannot act as if he ha ultim respons inde mani tradit present an interpret where believ ar suppos to interpret love on s neighbor as follow variou other rule and reli on their god to make thing come out right precis becaus it would be wrong for man to assum such ultim respons onc again we ar confront with good sound goo that mean whatev the reader want it to mean conserv mai twist thi act as if you were god to mean lai down rule for other peopl and be as nasti to them as possibl if thei don t keep your rule thei ar so insist and obviou about thi that thei have convinc a lot of peopl who rightli reject the whole concept that such idioci is how god act and who is to sai that thi interpret is twist there ar mani passag in the bibl that in their most straightforward read show the christian god behav in just thi wai michael cannot refer to base claim or base command to show that such read ar twist becaus thi diverg in understand occur even in try to interpret the base claim and command in address conserv christian michael will necessarili draw upon secular and cultur notion that these conserv christian will reject but why should anyon be look for an ethic system sinc our societi is eager to hand us on or more no matter what we do it mai be that we need a principl for the critiqu of ethic system in which case i will profer the _agap allel_ onc again but these base command ar too vagu to serv as a principl for the critiqu of ethic system the mean of these base command for ani believ deriv from the secular and cultur notion that the believ bring to them from how the believ mix their demand with straightforward read of other biblic passag from a particular sectarian tradit or from some combin of these thing these command lack suffici substanc in themself to serv as a basi for critic ethic system what mean thei have come from the ethic system the believ bring to these command and differ bodi of christian have from the begin urg differ ethic system or in some case none as a result it is bizarr to identifi ani on of these system howev popular or infam with christian christian doe not have a torah it doe not have a qu ran specif christian scriptur ha veri littl if anyth in the wai of command so littl that the christian who desper want command go mine for them with almost no support the on singl thing in the gospel which jesu specif give as a command to us is love on anoth jesu explicitli state that thi summar jewish law which would seem to bring in all of it if we properli understand what it mean to love god and love our neighbor there ar mani parabl and teach the gospel attribut to jesu that ar straightforwardli read as ethic command the paulin epistl ar similarli full if it is not clear that these all come togeth in a sensibl understand of ethic behavior the problem is not a lack of raw materi i am a radic christian onli in that i take the gospel serious no michael the conserv christian also take the gospel serious what differenti you is the wai you interpret the gospel why don t i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you someth about christian in a sens the wide varieti of interpret doe tell us someth about christian it tell us that the new testament author left a suffici vagu hodg podg that it can serv as the sourc text for mani vastli differ belief about the natur of the christian god and about what men should and shouldn t do the ironi here is that there is noth in christian per se that michael can us to support the caus of lesbian and gai everi christian principl he turn to thi caus is effect onli through the extra christian principl through which michael interpret hi religion and the homophob appli the same christian principl with equal justif to their caus in short it is the extra christian principl that make michael s christian benefici and i suspect thei would be as benefici perhap moreso without be filter by christian interpret michael paint a pictur of standard american atheism as the reject of the evil in mani conserv christian interpret of the bibl but i think it is even more damag to christian to note that the new testament present such a vagu hodg podg of notion about the natur of god and the natur of the good except of cours when it is order by an interpret that reli on extran principl here i think we should appli a christian parabl where a cold drink can have it valu and a hot drink can have it valu but the lukewarm we should spit out russel
