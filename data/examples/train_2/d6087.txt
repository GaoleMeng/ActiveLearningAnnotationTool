i have been have troubl post thi articl from within tin for over a week if you do get multipl copi my apolog here is a challeng to microsoft or microsort support to defend the pathet state of do 6 as an upgrad distribut it is a long stori but would make good read for those who ar interest in know the potenti pitfal of upgrad to do 6 that i have been abl to notic after onli about a week of plai around with it my envorin ti travelm 4000 winsx 486sx 25 4m ram 120m disk system bio version 1 03 05 21 92 by texa instrument cl gd6420 vga bio v 1 03 a1 by cirru logic quadtel advanc power manag batteri pro v b6 00 by texa instrument smart drive cach win3 1 do6 paramet 2048 1024 a b window benchmark winbench tm v 3 11 02 11 93 by zd lab after updgrad to do 6 i could not understand why certain thing becam so slow especi after i decid to try dblspace in the process of find out why i discov some interest thing disk perform with doubl space and smart drive while most thing did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applic appear to run veri much slower what wa interest is that command like chkdsk and defrag were run far too slowli to consid them us by ani standard i suspect doubl space ds and decid to measur it impact on my system us winbench tm the real disk winmark of 20350 for the origin system as ship from factori with do 5 and windoww 3 1 becam 10718 when upgrad to do 6 with ds thu there is an effect perform degrad of more than 50 percent which did not realli surpris me becaus i knew that ds compress must cost someth specif for short sequenti read up to 512 byte ds actual improv transfer rate by about 10% becaus cpu be faster than i o more cpu cycl need for ds is more than compens by save in i o cycl howev for all other case particularli larg random write the transfer take up to three time as long while the perform depend on the type of access i e random or sequenti small or larg transfer unit on the averag base on winbench s assumpt the disk slow down to half it speed the test alon done in real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not sai much except that it help to put into those subject statement like there is no notic differ in perform or even that it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk i o thi explain why some applic ran markedli slower but not why chkdsk and defrag the latter especi too so long doubl space and window dblspace will not run at all from within window not even if you want to onli to get inform not modifi anyth or for that matter even check on it usag try fasthelp dblspace in a do box within window and you will see what i mean from the error messag you get how narrow mind can a program get i wonder ye thi inform can be obtain through the mstool dd add on to file manag but thi mstool dll doe not understand a compress floppi us the do 6 supplement util to creat a compress floppi if you dont know how to do 6 defragment is incompat with ti apm defragment seem to take too much time even so i wait patient till it finish and then ran it again to just to confirm thi confirm dblspace def command for the 120m drive should take no more than 30 second much faster on other defragment i have us but it took 12 minut i discov that if i move the mous defragment check ran faster the % figur tick more rapidli it dawn on me that thi had to do with ti s batteri saver advanc power manag apm modul which slow the clock down when it think that the cpu is idl and it obvious thought ds defragment wa an idl process after disabl the ti s power saver thi oper took onli 20 second microsft programm think ti4000 and gatewai nomad user ar idiot in the readm txt file you can find the the follow run microsoft backup with ti4000 and gatewai nomad comput to avoid a conflict between the turbo featur and microsoft backup for window or ms do add a l0 switch to the devic command in your config sy that load the batteri pro file or befor you run microsoft backup type setpow l0 at the command prompt if you check ti s manual on the l0 option you will realis that it mean disabl all power save featur of your notebook why would anyon want to run a driver disabl as i have found out not onli doe ti s power manag interfer with microsoft backup as the readm txt claim but chkdsk and dblspace and who know what els ar crippl by the ti s power saver it is obviou that there is not such thing as apm specif if there inde is such a thing then either microsoft programm or ti programm dont know how to read these specif you dont have to guess as to who ar the idiot by the wai if you run the advanc power manag util power ex in do6 when you check the statu it sai power manag statu set adv max cpu idl 60% of time thi figur of 60% seem to be the steadi state valu on my notebook when i am run noth window with onli program manag in iconis form doe that mean that window take up 40% of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best onli 60% left for us work is such an overhead justifi whether or not window is an oper system or just anoth user interfac in do alon it report 99% idl time look like window is a good exampl of busi wait type of packag that i like my student to studi as the classic neg exampl of our time microsoft programm do not know batch program i like to structur my startup script and thu have the equival of addpath statement like thi set path c do set path c etc bin %path% c bin set path c etc window %path% c window set path %path% c bcc bin set path %path% %mous% even though the new do wa instal in the same directori as the old on i e c do do 6 instal program modif each and everi path statement and prepend c do to it valu as a result my result path ha so mani do s if the instal program want to remov the old do path and add the new do path clearli it ha to onli scan for the path statement conta the old do directori and replac it by the new do path even thi should onli be done if the new do is instal in a directori differ from the old on be upgrad instead the microsoft programm if you can call thi person on decid to meddl everi path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend do to the valu i wonder if microsoft is so despar that it would not fire programm who ar incap of the thought process i start a thread on thi when do 4 came up and the microsoft repres in singapor call me about thi poster in fact he specif said hi us counterpart saw the poster and relai the inform to him as he did not have access to internet now that ha not chang on bit in fact if you have a path statement with %path% alreadi in it is it not obviou that the thi statement should not be touch for ani reason as anoth exampl of the inabl of microsoft programm to understand batch program i had the mous driver invok as set mous c etc mous set path %path% %mous% loadhigh %mous% mous com guess what memmak did it replac the last statement with lh c etc mous mous com why is it so difficult just to replac loadhigh with lh and it paramet without touch the rest of the line i do not understand do 6 softwar qualiti do 6 is the onli oper system i know in which under normal usag you end up creat a file that you cannot get rid of us of the command that come with it i am deliber be cryptic about thi i challeng microsoft to us all it programm to catch thi bug and publish it if thei dont within a week i will post how you can creat thi ghost file sure if i can pick thi bug without even look for it after us a particular command onli twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programm randomli bang on their keyboard over a week could find it that is what i wa told how microsoft test the qualiti of their product i think it is funni that microsoft ha found wai to test qualiti when it is accept in the industri that qualiti cannot be test but can onli be built into the product no wonder thei cannot provid ani form of guarante on their product not even a decent list of bug that will prevent score of user from destroi their disk beyond repair also if you run dblspace def often enough repeatedli when the disk is fulli defrag you mai get error that wa creat by the defragment i got my io sy file size error and it got truncat when i did the chkdsk thi happend onli after five success defragment efforst after the first on supposedli did it job and with no new file creation sinc microsft dont you dare repli to thi poster on the network until you admit that your ds ha bug and ar will to let us know what we should watch out for if we have alreadi us ds jaya dr jayasooriah cse cs e unsw sign in a pari hotel p o box 1 kensington nsw 2033 tel fax 61 2 697 5683 313
