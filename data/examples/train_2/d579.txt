lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever back em best is just afraid the stupid thing ar go to fall apart and no on will bui them without assur why the hell do you think that lh ha been nicknam last hope you can do better and i know peopl will disagre with me here but japanes like honda or toyota or the onli american car compani that i feel is a qualiti product saturn i will not touch anoth chrysler product again no wai i don t care how good the lh car look good and i will admit thei look promis but not with the support that you get gm isn t much better thank god thei don t control saturn like thei do their divis or it would be just anoth market ploi don t get me wrong i will be watch my car which i do like like a hawk for the next 4 year i am much more hesit to sai it or ani car is realli good until it ha prove itself to me but sinc someon els point out c d as a sourc i will note becaus i us to read these magazin that car and driver ha never had a good thing to sai about most chrysler product shadow for on alwai were thei moan about the regurit k car and engin wherea motor trend alwai thought thei were great car no car magazin is realli object and although there ar alot of peopl who don t like consum report i will us them to reinforc my argument i alreadi know about the big stink with the saturn crash test time will tell how good a car thei ar the shadow sundanc rate much wors than averag in fact none of the chrysler s rate a better than averag i think the best on is just averag exclud the diamond star mitsubishi stuff and the lh s you can find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i research the saturn i could not find anyth bad about it there is a great deal of inform about thi compani just becaus it is a new american compani and it ha creat quit a stir in the automot commun for good reason much more than the introduct of ani new model line of ani establish compani i read an articl which had a sub column an i think thi imprint on me more than anyth els some big wig in toyota said and i quot we ar watch them veri close come on everybodi grow up the foreign car especi the japanes have been kick our butt for good reason the american car compani could not make a good product or support the custom the wai thei want these dai to set in their wai which is on of the reason saturn wa creat thei ar still struggl becaus thei haven t learn yet thei have the abil the worker ar not inferior the technolog is not out of date but their attitud is and thei ar just find thi out it s call competit gentleman women if you don t satisfi the demand of the consum well your out asbesto suit on gaia
