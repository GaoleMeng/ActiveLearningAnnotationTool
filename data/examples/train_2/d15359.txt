in the cours of discuss the sabbath with some folk i came across someth that wa complet new to me and i thought i d offer it for comment to keep thi as brief as possibl let me state my observ as a declar statement and then whoever want to can comment on it basic what i think i ve observ is that the phrase the ten command as us by mose is not a refer to ex 20 1 17 but rather a refer to ten distinct discours from ex 20 1 through ex 31 18 that is the phrase the ten command should more accur be translat the ten discours of which the passag we call the ten command is realli onli the first i m not complet convinc that the abov is true but for purpos of discuss let me argu it as though i wa sure argument support the abov idea 1 there aren t realli ten command in ex 20 1 17 in order to get 10 command you have to get two of them out of vers 3 6 and the vers themselv do not support such a divis becaus thei ar all about not worship other god that is vers 3 command to have no other god and vers 5 command to not worship the idol mention in vers 4 you can t violat vers 5 6 without violat vers 3 indic that the whole passag is on command and leav us with onli nine command i could go on at length about thi but for now i ll just stop with thi summari 2 there ar ten speech between ex 20 1 the begin of the tradit ten command and ex 31 18 where god actual give mose the two tablet with the ten command discours written on them i break these ten down as follow 20 1 17 20 22 26 21 1 23 33 25 1 30 10 30 11 16 30 17 21 30 22 33 30 34 38 31 1 11 and 31 12 18 in most case each of these passag begin with some variat of the phrase and the lord spoke to mose sai the except is ex 21 1 which begin now these ar the ordin which you ar to set befor them 3 the word translat command in the phrase the ten command isn t realli the word for command it the word for a speech or an utter it s a word often us for longer discours rather than individu statement for instanc when combin with the word yom dai thi word is translat chronicl in such phrase as now the rest of the act of so and so ar thei not written in the chronicl of x the word for command is freeli us throughout the book of mose and perhap it is signific that when mose spoke of the ten x s he appear to have avoid the word for command and chosen instead a word associ with discours longer than just a singl command 4 god tell mose that he is go to give him the stone tablet with the law and the command ex 24 12 yet he doe not give mose the tablet until he ha finish all ten discours on mount sinai if the ten command were onli ex 20 1 17 it is not immedi clear why god would wait sever dai and nine more discours befor give these tablet to mose on the other hand if we have the ten discours written on the tablet then it make perfect sens that god would not give mose the tablet until he had finish deliv all ten discours 5 when mose did get the tablet he found that both tablet were written on both side ex 32 15 if these ten command were onli the first 17 vers of ex 20 god would have had to have written in larg letter not that he couldn t have of cours but it doe seem more like to me that thi is a refer to two tablet contain ten discours written in normal size letter 6 in ii cor 3 paul seem to specif singl out the command written on stone as be the ministri of death that which is fade awai and the ministri of condemn with the possibl except of the command about the sabbath it is difficult to see why paul would refer to the command in ex 20 1 17 as be temporari fade awai type command thi is less of a problem if the stone tablet should happen to have includ all of the command from ex 20 through ex 31 argument against thi idea the main argument against thi idea asid from the fact that it contradict a long stand tradit is that in dt 5 22 mose sai after quot the command in ex 20 1 17 these word the lord spoke and he ad no more and he wrote them on two tablet of stone and gave them to me thi appear to identifi the word just quot as be the onli content of the two stone tablet that wa my first impress anywai howev after some thought i note that a great deal hing on how you understand the phrase these word if mose meant these word which i have just relat to you were spoken by god etc then that would mean that onli the tradit ten command were on the stone tablet if howev mose wa make a parenthet comment these word which i am now tell you were spoken by god etc then that s quit differ i did note that in the dt 5 account mose tell of be given the stone tablet befor tell of the peopl ask mose to repres them befor god wherea in the exodu account the peopl ask thi of mose between the first and second discours sever dai befor god gave mose the stone tablet thi reinforc the idea that mose remark in dt 5 22ff were intend as a parenthet remark rather than a strictli chronolog account of when god wrote what and at what point he stop ad to what wa on the tablet summari all thing consid i find it somewhat more like that the nine command in ex 20 ar realli onli the first of what mose regard as the ten discours of god i don t know if anybodi ha ever espous thi idea befor it s brand new to me so while i lean toward accept it i would be veri interest in hear ani comment and critic anyon mai care to offer mark
