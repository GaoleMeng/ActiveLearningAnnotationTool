the follow is base on copi i wa given of some articl publish in hear instrument i would appreci ani comment about thi and other new technolog for hear aid the resound system wa develop on the basi of some research at at t and appear to take a differ approach from other aid it appear to me that a new programm aid like the widex just us a more flexibl and programm version of the classic approach of amplifi some part of the spectrum more than other and ad some compress to try and help out in noisi situat the major differ in the resound approach is that it divid the spectrum into low and high frequenc split point is programm appar base on the fact that lot of vowel inform can be found in the low frequenc while the import conson inform unfortun for me is in the high frequenc the two band then ar treat with differ compress scheme which ar program thei have also develop a new fit algorythm that build on what thei call abnorm growth of loud thi latter is interest and fit my own person experi though i think the phrase is misslead what appear to be the case is that as you exce the minimum threshold for a person with hear loss the deficit becom progressl less compar to normal and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensit curv appear to converg thi mean that if you just boost all sound level you ar overload at the high end for peopl with hear loss henc what you want is progress less amplif as the signal get closer to the maximum toler point you want to boost low volum sound more than high and do so potenti differ for the low and high frequenc part of the spectrum special for someon like me who is rel normal up to 1000 cp and then fall off a cliff aid with simpl compressor don t descrimin between energi in the low and high frequenc and can therefor compress us high frequenc inform becaus of high volum of low frequenc compon particularli impress wa the resound perform with whisper speech and in simul restaur nois situat rich haller rhaller ns uoregon edu univers of oregon eugen or usa
