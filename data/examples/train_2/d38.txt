i ve had a valentin for about 9 month now and i agre that it is the best det ector avail the point here is trust and reliabl i ve been abl to tr ust the valentin more than ani other detector i ve owend if the valentin sa ys that there is a moder to strong radar sourc in front of me then it s mo re than like to be a speed trap with my other detector i ve gotten so mani fals that i ve begun to ignor someo of the warn becaus i didn t want t o drive like i had on foot on the brake and on on the ga pedal that direct indic realli realli help plu more info is almost alwa ys better than less info no matter how smart radar detector get the human br ain is usual smarter so if i m go to make a decisio base on inform at hand i want all the info i can get plu if you divid the overal streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogei report you ll find that each bogei is pretti weak and therefor not a radar threat with other detector yo u ll just get on strong warn my logic mai be faulti on thi but i think i t work okai although i must admit that i haven t realli notic the reflect problem of on radar souc thoma
