butler newsgroup talk religion misc subject re new biblic contradict fallaci answer juda date fri apr 2 02 32 11 1993 i ow the group an apolog it is my habit to check my articl befor and after their submiss for error in my last articl i state by the wai mr decenso you realli should have look in the index of your bauer arndt gingrich greek lexicon you would have found that the word in act for lot is klero not chorion as state by mr archer and nowher in the veri larg discuss of klero in done the to theolog dictionari of the new testament by bromlei is the mean burial plot discuss it discuss the form of klero eg klero kleroo etc and the variou mean of klero eg plot of land and inherit but mention noth about chorion or burial plot why doe thi not surpris me thu it would seem to be a veri good thing you dump archer as a refer i wa wrong i admit that i do not have a handl on greek grammar and thu confus klero the second to last word in act 1 17 as be the plot of land discuss in actual it is chorion which is the last word act 1 18 unfortun my greek dictionari doe not discuss chorion so i cannot report as to the nuanc of the word i don t know if someon els would have caught thi though i am sure that someon would be abl to do so but i have an avers to dissemin mistak especi when someon els might us that mistak to prove a point _____________________________________________________________________ my repli vari nobl of you dave i didn t want to have to go to x number of sourc to show you wrong although i am research chorion a littl db of cours the onli other refer mr decenso ha given is bulling and bulling us such ridicul exegisi that when i accus mr decenso of actual believ bulling he repli that i misquot him and you maintain that you find such exegesi convinc oh dear my repli your misquot of me ar astound dave read the begin of thi part of my respons to see what i realli said in my post of thi articl actual mr decenso you said that there wa benefit to our argument in that it caus to to rediscov bulling s exegisi i did not realiz that you would find such garbag benefici unless you were convinc by it my repli thank you for correct your restat of my point db and mr decenso also repli dave these ar not necessarili my view thei ar bulling s we will discuss the land issu in later post i m sure i m onli respond to thi on you have direct re bulling s view becaus it s enjoy thu i apolog for think that even mr decenso could find such drek convinc he should specifi which part of bulling he find convinc and quit hide behind a disingenu mask of thi is what bulling believ not necessarili what i believ so which is it mr decenso do you find the exegisi convinc or not my repli on of my purpos in debat these alleg contradict with you and other is to disemin mani differ view of possibl reconcili rais by variou bibl scholar and student alik when i present my view i will clearli distinguish them from now on db of cours without archer and bulling we find that mr decenso ha present no greek exegisi at all and mr decenso ha made a big thing about my not refer back to the actual greek thu we find thi demand on hi part for qualiti greek exegisi to be a hypocrit requir my repli good point but in your declar that these passag ar contradictori you have produc onli superfici reason and observ nor have you dug deeper i m glad you have begun in thi post i will begin greek studi on these passag in more depth than i thought necessari as well db it would be appropri to look at what mr decenso ha actual us as evid now we know what he claim for a standard as he ha state it often enough a the text itself b parallel passag c other pertin scriptur d histor context e histor content f other pertin histor info g cultur context h cultur content i other pertin cultur info j grammat construct k hebrew and greek word studi l etc but ar these actual standard he ha us or simpli empti hyperbol let s see he ha us a and sinc he is try to reconcil it to other passag we see that he ha also us b on the other hand he ha present no us of d histor context or e histor content or f other pertin histor info or g cultur context or h cultur content or i other pertin cultur info or j grammat construct or even k hebrew and greek word studi rememb archer and bulling don t count thu we find hi vaunt criteria for exegisi is just empti mouth my repli question do you find such criteria import if so do you plan on start to us them to the best of your abil or will you continu to present shallow observ i don t mean thi in a bad wai at thi point in our _debat_ i have not found it necessari to present a total exeget analysi of these passag sinc we seem to keep beat around the bush and not get into the core of the vers i do not believ it necessari to us mani of the abov criteria to refut your argument re juda in act and matthew but i will do my best from thi point on to us sever of the abov criteria sinc you desir me to i hope you will also it will greatli enhanc our studi of these passag db the onli thing he ha actual us beyond the passag itself is ani other passag thu mr decenso should be honest and note that most of hi list is red her and hi onli real criteria seem to be a the text itself b parallel passag my repli the reason is simpl you ar mistat the passag you claim that the passag contradict on anoth i do not see the passag contradict on anoth 1 thei mai veri well be complimentari as mani scholarli sourc mention 2 matthew mai not be present juda death as you claim but we ll look at your defens of thi later also the reward of iniqu in the act passag mai not be the 30 piec of silver in matthew s passag although you have a valiant attempt later at state why you believ it is at thi begin stage in our debat we ar lai some scriptur groundwork which will be expand upon through deeper exegesi db of cours the onli reason i can see to so drastic reinterpret a passag as he ha done with juda death is to make it agre with anoth passag so that both could be consid correct my repli on of the reason i have given a differ exeget view of the passag is that you seem to think the major of scholarship is wrong in conclud these passag ar complimentari howev i see no problem in toni rose s explan of juda death _____________________________________________________________________ how would you explain the inaccuraci between juda hang himself in matthew 27 5 and fall headlong he burst open thi question of the manner in which juda di is on with which we ar constantli confront in our travel mani peopl point to the appar discrep in the two account as an obviou irreconcil error some have gone so far as to sai that the idea of an inerr bibl is destroi by these contradictori account howev thi is not the case at all matthew relat that juda hang himself while peter tell us he fell and wa crush by the impact the two statement ar inde differ but do thei necessarili contradict each other matthew doe not sai that juda did not fall neither doe peter sai that juda did not hang himself thi is not a matter of on person call someth black and the other person call it white both account can be true and supplementari a possibl reconstruct would be thi juda hang himself on a tree on the edg of a precipic that overlook the vallei of hinnom after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope gave wai and juda fell down the ledg mangl hi bodi in the process the fall could have been befor or after death as either would fit thi explan thi possibl is entir natur when the terrain of the vallei of hinnom is examin from the bottom of the vallei you can see rocki terrac 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular there ar still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom therefor it is easi to conclud that juda struck on of the jag rock on thi wai down tear hi bodi open it is import to rememb that we ar not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanc wa the decomposit of hi bodi befor hi fall loui gaussen relat a stori of a man who wa determin to kill himself thi individu place himself on the sill of a high window and point a pistol at hi head he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time on the other hand a person could sai that thi man took hi life by shoot himself while anoth could rightli contend he commit suicid by jump form the tall build in thi case both ar true as both ar true in the case of matthew s and peter s account of the death of juda it is mere a situat of differ perspect of the same event _____________________________________________________________________ your onli reason for reject thi is i believ your attempt to discredit inerr you haven t relat how thi is imposs or highli unlik here s what you said in an earlier post _____________________________________________________________________ db quot toni rose there ar still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom therefor it is easi to conclud that juda struck on of the jag rock on thi wai down tear hi bodi open it is import to rememb that we ar not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanc wa the decomposit of hi bodi befor hi fall the ad text in thi version is so heavi that assum you ar truli so oppos to such tactic you should find it not credibl but you seem to find toni rose s eisegesi satisfactori while clearli reject david joslin s _____________________________________________________________________ here you discredit toni s explan base on what you deem too heavi for the passag but you haven t address why you feel that wai you can sai it s a vain attempt to reconcil the contradict but that doesn t tell me it didn t happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibl question is matthew ly or is luke ly or ar thei both ly or ar either or both of them misinform why do you think there is such an alleg contradict i do not think you have ever told us what you believ in thi respect db at present though mr decenso onli ask two question of me 1 you claim act and matthew contradict on anoth in repres juda death i ask you again to provid evid that matthew state juda di in the hang 2 you claim that the 30 piec of silver in matthew that juda threw down in the templ and the chief priest us is the reward of iniqu in act that pictur juda in some wai purchas a field with therefor there is a contradict prove that the 30 piec of silver and the reward of iniqu ar on and the same actual i find question 1 to be a rather stupid request but i will answer it becaus he now restrict himself to two point first i would point out that hang is a veri effici manner for end a life in fact it is a bit of a fluke when someon surviv hang except in fantasi cowboi movi and even then it usual refer to as an attempt hang my repli i work at an agenc that investig child abus and neglect todai i got a call re a child that attempt suicid by hang himself becaus hi mother is on crack he fail in hi attempt and is in a child s psych ward at a local hospit hang attempt ar not alwai success to assum that becaus most hang ar success thi on wa also is beg the question if i mai quot you last night listen to _the bibl answer man_ broadcast the christian research institut s show on of the scholar on there us sever of these term that you us i am not all that familiar with them the man on the bam show teach compar religion and logic it wa interest db thi is so preval that so that to sai a man hung himself with no other qualifi is synonym with state that he kill himself my repli qualifi ar import at time as we ll see in an ot passag i ll mention below doe hang alwai have thi outcom did matthew who is the onli sourc we have re juda hang himself state that juda di as a result to sai it s synonym mean it ha the same mean as a boi ag 14 hung himself but he live thi is onli on of probabl thousand of document case we can discov db now i am not alon in thi thought in fact sinc mr decenso so respect christian scholarli includ greek scholar opinion i did some research my repli thank you dave db interestingli not on of the christian refer i read interpret the hang as be anyth but a fatal suicid my repli abov mine so it s ok to us christian sourc to back your point what about toni s posit do you valu it or even consid it as a valid possibl also is it possibl that the sourc you read mai be wrong or ly or deceiv in other part of their book if so should we do as we have done with archer toss them to the side and not valu anyth thei sai includ their interpret of the hang of juda i am sure _you_ would find some error and mayb even some decept in those sourc you also note thei interpret the hang as mean he di although that is veri possibl true do you find that in the text itself rememb that s the first criteria we must examin db thi includ the biblic knowledg commentari by woodward and zuck my repli which i own it s a good sourc of commentari info but not inerr db the interpret on volum commentari on the bibl by laydon the on volum bibl commentari by j r dunelow word mean of the testament ralph earl the abingdon bibl commentari publish by abingdon harper bibl commentari by william neal actual i could have present mani more as well my repli i appreci your do thi research dave mayb we ar get somewher in how we both should approach these alleg contradict more in depth studi db in each case these refer specif describ that the interpret of matt 27 5 as success suicid and thu i can onli conclud that the greek word apagchw ie hang oneself is translat as a success hang my repli abov mine no you can t onli conclud thi although as toni sai thi wa a highli probabl outcom but matthew doe not state death as be a result the greek word is apagcho matthew 27 5 is it s onli occurr in the new testament in the septuagint the greek translat of the ot us at the time of jesu it s onli us in 2 samuel 17 23 now when ahithophel saw that hi advic wa not follow he saddl a donkei and aros and went home to hi hous to hi citi then he put hi household in order and hang himself and di and he wa buri in hi father s tomb notic that not onli is it state that ahithophel hang himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitli add and di here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we ar not explicitli told juda di also there is noth in the greek to suggest success or failur it simpli mean hang oneself db but mr decenso you ar more than welcom to disagre and show more reput christian scholar that insist that the hang wa not success my repli abov mine reput you mean on that have never er as far as insist that the hang wa unsuccess that can t be done even by me as i said in an earlier post _____________________________________________________________________ although i still agre with toni s exegesi as be the most probabl explan regard juda death take into account sever criteria i ve recent notic some new thing in matthew mat 27 5 8 then he threw down the piec of silver in the templ and depart and went and hang himself but the chief priest took the silver piec and said it is not law to put them into the treasuri becaus thei ar the price of blood and thei consult togeth and bought with them the potter s field to buri stranger in therefor that field ha been call the field of blood to thi dai first of all notic that the text doe not sai that juda di as a result of hang all it sai is that he went and hang himself luke howev in act tell us that and fall headlong he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out thi is a pretti clear indic along with the other detail given in act peter s speech the need to pick a new apostl etc that at least after juda fall he wa dead so the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount juda death is highli probabl but not clear cut _____________________________________________________________________ i also wrote _____________________________________________________________________ my repli here we have a stickler dave that i have to sai i just recent notic let s look at the passag in matthew mat 27 4 sai i have sin by betrai innoc blood and thei said what is that to us you see to it mat 27 5 then he threw down the piec of silver in the templ and depart and went and hang himself mat 27 6 but the chief priest took the silver piec and said it is not law to put them into the treasuri becaus thei ar the price of blood mat 27 7 and thei consult togeth and bought with them the potter s field to buri stranger in mat 27 8 therefor that field ha been call the field of blood to thi dai notic vers 5 then he went and hang himself matthew doe not sai juda di doe it should we assum he di as a result of the hang what doe act sai act 1 18 now thi man purchas a field with the wage of iniqu and fall headlong he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out act 1 20 for it is written in the book of psalm let hi dwell place be desol and let no on live in it and let anoth take hi offic here we mai have a graphic explan of juda death so my line of reason to dispel your contradict myth re the two account of juda death is thi matthew doesn t necessarili explain how juda di he doe sai juda hang himself but he didn t specif sai juda di in the hang incid howev act seem to show us hi graphic demis therefor there is no contradict between matthew and act re juda death my repli we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and act probabl record hi death although it s possibl and plausibl that he fell from the hang and hit some rock therebi burst open i can no longer assum that to be the case therefor no contradict matthew did not sai juda di as a result of the hang did he most scholar believ he probabl did but ______________________________________________________________________ i quot all that to show that i highli regard the scholar explan but in look at the text initi we can t assum juda di it is howev highli probabl db by the wai while all agre that juda di from the hang the book had differ wai of deal with the contradict we ar discuss on simpli ignor it entir and simpli refer back to matthew s version as the correct version in both matt and act the biblic knowledg commentari suggest the hypothes that juda hung and then when he rot hi belli explod which doesn t explain hi headlong fall or that hi branch or rope broke and he fell to hi death and hi gut gush out which doesn t explain how a hang man would fall headlong rather than feet first my repli the outcom of ani fall is depend upon mani factor how high the person wa suspend befor the fall ani obstruct such as tree branch that mai have deviat the fall how steep an inclin of rocki surfac the victim fell upon thu possibl roll or bounc of sever rock etc in a superfici examin of the act passag and the matthew passag we ar not given a lot of info on the geograph specif but toni in the abov quot post gave us some _____________________________________________________________________ a possibl reconstruct would be thi juda hang himself on a tree on the edg of a precipic that overlook the vallei of hinnom after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope gave wai and juda fell down the ledg mangl hi bodi in the process the fall could have been befor or after death as either would fit thi explan thi possibl is entir natur when the terrain of the vallei of hinnom is examin from the bottom of the vallei you can see rocki terrac 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular there ar still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom therefor it is easi to conclud that juda struck on of the jag rock on thi wai down tear hi bodi open _____________________________________________________________________ db now truthfulli i do not see what is comfort about matthew confus the sourc of the potter s field prophesi but on the other hand the author is correct matthew doe make that confus of cours a biblic inerrantist who claim that everi word of the bibl is guarante true by god will have to therebi add on more contradict to the death of juda ie where the prophesi of the potter s field came from my repli pleas when we ar done with thi studi on hi death remind me to discuss thi with you db as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the monei with which juda purchas the land wa inde for the betray rather than some other sourc i would point out that in act where it specif mention the reward of iniqu act 1 18 it also specif mention what act of iniqu thei were talk about ie act 1 16 concern juda who wa guid to those who arrest jesu now i would point out that when the bibl describ an act of iniqu and then immedi discuss the reward of iniqu it would be rather inan to suggest that it wa an action of iniqu other than the on discuss my repli dave we ar get somewher aren t we act 1 15 and in those dai peter stood up in the midst of the discipl altogeth the number of name wa about a hundr and twenti and said act 1 16 men and brethren thi scriptur had to be fulfil which the holi spirit spoke befor by the mouth of david concern juda who becam a guid to those who arrest jesu act 1 17 for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministri act 1 18 now thi man purchas a field with the wage of iniqu and fall headlong he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out act 1 19 and it becam known to all those dwell in jerusalem so that field is call in their own languag akel dama that is field of blood act 1 20 for it is written in the book of psalm let hi dwell place be desol and let no on live in it and let anoth take hi offic notic that in vers 16 the word iniqu is not us rather it state that juda becam a guid to those who arrest jesu but the writer did not stop there vs 17 for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministri what part did juda plai in their ministri joh 12 6 thi he said not that he care for the poor but becaus he wa a thief and had the monei box and he us to take what wa put in it joh 13 29 for some thought becaus juda had the monei box that jesu had said to him bui those thing we need for the feast or that he should give someth to the poor so now we know what part juda plai he wa a treasur per se right after peter state that juda plai a part in thi ministri treasur accord to john then luke add the parenthet explan of wage of iniqu monei that should have been put into the ministri but wa stolen by juda to purchas a field i believ thi is a better exeget explan of what the wage of iniqu ar what do you think dave db now sinc i have given you clear answer and even refer perhap you could unequivoc state what type of inerrantist you ar instead of ask me what type i think you ar as you did to mr joslin my repli i will gladli admit that i am a complet inerrantist although i do not have that big a problem with the limit inerr view frank if on wish to contend with him he could not answer him on time out of a thousand job 9 3
