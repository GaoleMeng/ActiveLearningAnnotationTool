correl with irrat belief in absolut irrat belief in absolut is strongli correl with fanat delet theism is correl with fanatic i have neither said that all fanat is caus by theism nor that all theism lead to fanat the point is theism increas the chanc of becom a fanat on could of cours argu that would be fanat tend toward theism for exampl but i just have to loook at the time in histori when theism wa the domin ideolog to invalid that conclus that that is the basic mechan behind it imo the influenc of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalid your assumpt that theism is the factor to be consid bogu i just said that theism is not the onli factor for fanat the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consid your argument as us as the follow belief is strongli correl with fanatic therefor belief is a factor in fanatic true and utterli useless note thi is ani belief not belief in god gullibl blind obedi to author lack of sceptic and so on ar all more reliabl indic and the realli danger peopl the sourc of fanatic ar often none of these thing thei ar cynic manipul of the gullibl who know precis what thei ar do that s a claim you have to support pleas note that especi in the field of theism the leader believ what thei sai if you believ that you re incred naiv now some brand of theism and more precis some theist do tend to fanatic i grant you to tar all theist with thi brush is bigotri not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm up for censorship and restrict of religi freedom ever read anim farm that s a straw man and as usual in discuss with you on ha to repeat it read what i have written abov not everi theism lead to fanat and not all fanat is caus by theism the point is there is a correl and it come from innat featur of theism no some of it come from featur which some theism ha in common with some fanatic your last statement simpli isn t impli by what you sai befor becaus you re try to sneak in innat featur of all theism the word you re grope for is some gullibl by the wai is on of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibl instead of theism sinc it seem a whole lot more relev to the case you have as oppos to the case you ar try to make and to sai that i am go to forbid religion is anoth of your straw men interest that you have noth better to offer i said it read like a warm up to that that s becaus it s an irrat and bogu tirad and ha no other us than creat a nice them us split in the mind of excit peopl such as ar to be found on either side of church wall 2 defin irrat belief e g is it ration to believ that reason is alwai us irrat belief is belief that is not base upon reason the latter ha been discuss for a long time with charlei wingat on point is that the belief violat reason often and anoth that a process that doe not lend itself to ration analysi doe not contain reliabl inform well there is a glare paradox here an argument that reason is us base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrat which is it that s bogu self refer is not circular and sinc the evalu of us is possibl within ration system it is allow o k it s oval it s still beg the question howev and though that certainli is allow it s not ration and you claim to be ration and all at the risk of repeat myself and hear we had that befor we didn t hear a _refut_ befor so we re back deal with it you can t us reason to demonstr that reason is us someon who think reason is crap won t bui it you see your argument is as silli as prove mathemat statement need mathemat and mathemat ar therfor circular anybodi els think godel wa silli the first part of the second statement contain no inform becaus you don t sai what the belief ar if the belief ar strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in gener true the second part of your sentenc is patent fals counterexampl an axiomat datum doe not lend itself to ration analysi but is assum to contain reliabl inform regardless of what process is us to obtain it i ve been speak of religi system with contradictori definit of god here an axiomat datum lend itself to ration analysi what you sai here is a an often refut fallaci have a look at the discuss of the axiom of choic and further on can evalu axiom in larger system out of which thei ar usual deriv i exist is deriv if you want it that wai further on can test the consist and so on of a set of axiom what is it you ar try to sai that at some point peopl alwai wind up sai thi datum is reliabl for no particular reason at all exampl i am not dream compar the evid theist have for their claim to the strength of their demand make the whole thing not onli irrat but antir i can t agre with thi until you ar specif which theism to sai that all theism is necessarili antir requir a proof which i suspect you do not have us the traditon definit of god person supernatur entiti with object effect on thi world usual connect to moral and or the wai the world work imo ani belief about such god is necessarili irrat that doe not mean that peopl who hold them ar in principl oppos to the exercis of intellig some atheist ar also scientist for exampl the affin to fanat is easili seen it ha to be true becaus i believ it is noth more than a work hypothesi howev the belief sai thei ar more than a work hypothesi i don t understand thi can you formalis your argument person a believ system b becuas it sound so nice that doe not make b true it is at best a work hypothesi howev the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesi test or evalu evid for or against it therefor dismiss becaus b alreadi believ sai it is wrong a wast of time not possibl depend on the further content of b amalekit idolat protest ar to be kill thi can have interest effect peculiar definit of interest but sure now show that a belief in god entail the further content of which you speak why aren t my cathol neighbour out kill the protest for exampl mayb thei don t believ in it mayb it s the conjunct of b assert b and jail kill dissent that is import and the belief in god is entir irrelev it certainli seem so to me but then i have no ax to grind here frank o dwyer i m not hatch that odwyer sse ie from hen by evelyn conlon
