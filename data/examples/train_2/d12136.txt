veriti jack sn com steve veriti write i am try to build a circuit that detect the presenc of video vs a blank screen by monitor the r g and b output of a graphic card it should be abl to detect the presenc of a singl pixel at 65 mhz which would mean detect a 15 ns puls it should also be abl to tell the differ between a blank screen about 300 mv and a dim screen sai around 310 mv oh ye it also need to be cheap my first circuit wa a dismal failur i us 3 compari each compari had the input go to on of the gun the input went to a refer creat by a voltag divid a potentiomet the first problem wa that the compari wa wai too slow i need to get sever pixel in a row befor it would fire the compari so i could have a whole screen full of text but my the second problem is that there wa more nois on the refer then the smallest differ between a blank screen and a dim screen in fact the differ between complet black and complet white is onli 650 mv i am wonder if i am go to have to amplifi the video signal to make thi work there ar faster compari but thei ar expens and requir split suppli i would need to replac my 49 quad compari with three 1 89 compari and creat a whole new power suppli circuit at thi point i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit transistor ar fast and cheap and should do the trick unfortun i am wai out of my leagu when it come to design transistor circuit so i am appeal to the net for help ani idea tip circuit pointer refer etc would be greatli appreci oh ye i onli sampl the output of thi thing everi second or so so i don t need a fast respons time at all howev i haven t found a wai to take advantag of that fact thank a lot for ani help anybodi might be abl to give of cours you will have my undi gratitud steve veriti steve veriti max on midi veriti jack sn com in order to get the 15 ns respons time you need you ar better off go to an ecl slicer which can run off a singl 5 or 5 2 v suppli you just need to bia or do some level shift perhap to get it in the rang check out the ecl 10k book for a simpl cheap solut dino inqmind bison mb ca the inquir mind bb winnipeg manitoba 204 488 1607
