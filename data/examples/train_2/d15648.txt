here s someth preston covei professor of ethic at cmu wrote from preston k covei covei andrew cmu edu subject gun stat mortal risk date mon 15 feb 1993 18 35 05 0500 est folk hail from the nether world on februari 4th the wall street journal carri a front page articl by erik larson entitl arm forc i felt a repli wa in order to hi citat of the notori scare stat that a gun is 43 time more like to kill than to protect i sent the follow to the wsj gun stat mortal risk preston k covei erik larson s even hand articl on paxton quiglei arm forc 2 4 93 wsj cite the world s most notori statist regard gun in the home a pioneer studi of residenti gunshot death in king counti washington found that a gun in the home wa 43 time more like to be us to kill it owner spous a friend or child than to kill an intrud the 43 time stat is everywher these dai it ha grown in media lore like the proverbi urban myth it wa inflat by on pugilist talk show pundit to 93 given the shock valu of the find the conclus of the 1986 new england journal of medicin nejm studi is remark underst the advis of keep firearm in the home for protect must be question respons peopl should inde question the risk and benefit of bring a firearm into their home but what we need to know is thi what exactli ar the risk and benefit the nejm testimoni is neither the whole truth about the benefit nor noth but the truth about the risk further as with motor vehicl we want to know what control do we have over the risk and benefit and as with the risk of cancer or heart diseas or auto accid how can we minim the risk like raw highwai death toll the nejm stat is not veri help here the nejm find purport to inform us but it is frame to warn us off it is wide promulg in the media as a scare stat a mislead half truth whose veri formul is calcul to prejudic and terrifi the fright statist scream for itself the risk far outweigh the benefit ye what fool would run these risk if your car were 43 time more like to kill you a love on a dear friend or an innoc child than to get you to your destin should you not take the bu uncrit citat put the good name of statist in the bad compani of li and damn li sure we can do better where live ar at stake let s take a closer look at thi riski busi the 43 time stat of the nejm studi is the product of divid the number of home intrud aggressor justifi kill in self defens the divisor into the number of famili member or acquaint kill by a gun in the home the dividend the divisor of thi risk equat is 9 in the studi s five year sampl there were 2 intrud and 7 other case of self defens the dividend is 387 in the studi there were 12 accident death 42 crimin homicid and 333 suicid 387 divid by 9 yield 43 there were a total of 743 gun relat death in king counti between 1978 and 1983 so the studi leav 347 death outsid of home unaccount the nejm s notori 43 time statist is serious mislead on six count 1 the dividend is misleadingli character in the media the or acquaint of the studi who includ your friendli drug dealer and neighborhood gang member is equat to friend the implic is that the offend gun target and kill onli belov famili member dear friend and innoc children death mai all be equal tragic but the charact and circumst of both victim and killer ar relev to the risk these crucial risk factor ar mask by the calcul impress that the death toll is gener by witless walton shoot dear friend and friendli neighbor thi is criminolog hogwash 2 the studi itself doe not distinguish household or environ popul by peopl with violent crimin or substanc abus histori where the risk of death is veri high versu household inhabit by more civil folk for exampl peopl who avoid high risk activ like drug deal gang bang and wife beat where the risk is veri low inde in actual neglig adult allow fatal but avoid accid and homicid ar perpetr mostli by peopl with histori of violenc or abus peopl who ar identifi and certifi at high risk for misadventur to ignor these obviou risk factor in firearm accid and homicid is as mislead as ignor the role of alcohol in vehicular death by tautolog neither gun death nor vehicular death would occur without firearm or vehicl but the person and circumst of the gun owner or driver crucial affect the risk 3 on mislead implic of the wai the nejm stat is frame is that the mere presenc of a gun in the home is much more like to kill than to protect and thi obscur inde disregard the role of person respons the typic quotat of thi studi unlik larson s attribut fatal agenc to the gun a gun in the home is 43 time as like to kill the center to prevent handgun violenc a major promulg of the nejm statist us thi particular formul we can dispens with the silli debat about whether it s peopl or gun that accomplish the kill again by tautolog gun death would not occur without the gun the question beg is how mani death would occur anywai without the gun in ani case peopl ar the death deal agent the gun ar their lethal instrument the moral core of the person risk factor in gun death ar person respons and choic due care and respons obviat gun accid human choic mediat homicid and suicid by gun or otherwis the choic to own a gun need not condemn a person to nejm s high risk pool the gun doe not creat thi risk by itself peopl have a lot to sai about what risk thei run with gun in their home for exampl graduat of paxton quiglei s person protect cours do not run the tout 43 time risk ani more than skill and sober driver run the same risk of caus or suffer vehicular death as do reckless or drunk driver undiscrimin actuari disregard and obscur the role of person respons and choic just as thei disregard and obscur the role of socio econom criminolog and other risk relev factor in firearm relat death thi is why we resent insur premium and actuari consig to risk pool whose norm disregard our individu fortun noth can consign us to the nejm risk pool but our own lack of choic or respons in the matter 4 suicid account for 84% of the death by gun in the home in the nejm studi as against the total death by gun in king counti includ those outsid the home in hous suicid ar 44% of the total death toll which is closer to the roughli 50% proport found by other studi suicid is a social problem of a veri differ order from homicid or accid the implic of the nejm studi is that these suicid might not occur without readili avail gun it is true that attempt suicid by gun is like to succe it is not obvious true that the absenc of a gun would prevent ani or all of these suicid thi is wide assum or alleg but the preponder of research on gun and suicid actual show otherwis that thi is wish think in all but a few truli impuls case see bruce l danto et al the human side of homicid columbia univers press 1982 charl rich et al gun and suicid american journal of psychiatri march 1990 if suicid were remov from the dividend of the nejm studi s risk equat the 43 time stat would deflat to six the inclus of suicid in the nejm risk equat like the caus durabl or interdict of suicid intent itself is a profoundli debat matter quotat of the nejm studi total disregard thi issu 5 citat of the nejm studi also mislead regard the estim rate of justifi and excus homicid most measur like the nejm homicid rate ar base on the immedi disposit of case but mani homicid initi rule crimin ar appeal and later rule self defens in the literatur on batter women immedi case disposit ar notori for under repres the rate of justifi or excus homicid time s januari 18 1993 cover stori on women fight back report on studi s find that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convict thrown out time s juli 17 1989 cover stori on a week of gun death report 51% of the domest case as shoot by abus victim but onli 3% of the homicid were report as self defens in a mai 14 1990 updat time report that 12% of the homicid had eventu been rule self defens in time s sampl the origin report rate of self defens wa in error by a factor of four the possibl of such error is not acknowledg by promulg of the nejm statist 6 while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equat ar arguabl inflat the divisor is unconscion mislead the divisor of thi equat count onli aggressor who ar kill not aggressor who ar successfulli thwart without be kill or even shot at the util of arm self defens is the other side of the coin from the harm done with gun in home what kind of moral idioci is it to measur thi util onli in term of kill do we measur the util of our polic sole in term of felon kill as oppos to the mani mani more who ar otherwis foil apprehend or deter should we not celebr let alon count those case where no human life is lost as success arm defens the question pose to media that cite the nejm scare stat is thi why neglect the compendi research on success arm defens notabl by criminologist gari kleck point blank gun and violenc in america aldin de gruyter 1992 kleck s estim of the rate and risk of defens firearm us ar base on victim survei as well as other studi the rate is high about on million a year and the risk is good gun defend fare better than anyon either those who resort to other form of resist or those who do not resist divid on million gun defens a year by 30 000 annual gun death from self defens homicid suicid and accid yield 33 thu we can construct a much more favor statist than the nejm scare stat a gun is 33 time more like to be us to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybodi of cours kleck s critic belittl the dividend of thi calcul what is good new for gun defend is bad new for gun control we should inde question the basi and method of kleck s high estim of defens firearm us as i have question the nejm statist clearli the issu of how to manag mortal risk is not settl by uncrit citat of statist on thing troubl me still we can hardli escap the unquest nejm scare stat in our media but we hardli ever find kleck s good work mention even critic larri cipriani
