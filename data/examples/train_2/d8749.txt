some peopl work a few cube over have come up with thi need and it seem that someon out there just might have done it alreadi and can point me to some tool that would help what thei d like to do is given a window that is take a long time to draw becaus either the data is arriv over a slow link or the $displai is across a slow link thei would like to first paint a low resolut version of the pictur and then repaint it in higher resolut thu the pictur might first be gener in 1 4 resolut with each 4x4 squar of pixel be fill in with a singl color next each 4x4 squar would be replac by 4 2x2 squar final the 1x1 version would be paint sinc on of the scenario is with the window be on the other side of a slow link the low re version obvious wouldn t be transmit as a bitmap that wouldn t help at all instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receiv the low re pictur as a small bitmap and blow up each pixel into a squar sorta like the magnifi program do thi bring up the question of whether the x server can help that is when a window is open is there a wai to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixel or is the onli wai to us someth like rsh to start up a remot process permiss deni and have it open a local window it seem the most like scenario is a librari routin that start up such a program remot and then accept bitmap compress each on by some amount and send them to the remot program to expand but if there is someth that x itself can do to help it s be nice to hear about it i look in sever fm but if it s there i obvious don t know the keyword if someon ha a nifti tool avail that packag it all we might want to get a copi oh ye thi is to run on some sun part of the idea is to build demo that can show such thing as if thi were run across sai a 4800 bp link thi is how fast the pictur would appear then the custom would get a feel for the speed that thei need to pai for if the auto industri were like the comput industri a car would now cost $5 would get 5000 mile to the gallon and at random time would explod kill all it passeng
