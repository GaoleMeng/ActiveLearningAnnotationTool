kevin anthonei kax cs nott ac uk wrote about my repli diplomat it a societi that is constantli on the verg of flame usenet diplomaci is the best wai to ensur the voic of reason get through isn t it i realiz i m fight occam s razor in thi argument so i ll try to explain why i feel a mind is necessari kevin unfortun you ar now delv into field i know too littl about algorithm your reason as i see it is veri much along the line of roger penros who claim that mathemat insight cannot be algorithm in hi book _the emperor s new mind concern comput mind and the law of physic_ howev penros s claim that he _ha_ mathemat insight or your similar claim that wavefunct collaps onli when we conscious take a look could be just illus we ar obviouslu take veri differ viewpoint i try to ponder on the problem of conscious from an evolutionari perspect realis that it might not be anyth special but certainli us think back of what i wrote do you think worm have mind or not thei ar abl to experi pain at least thei behav just like that yet it is conceiv that we might some dai in the futur perform a total synthesi of c elegan from the element would such a worm have a mind firstli i m not impress with the abil of algorithm thei re great at solv problem onc the method ha been work out but not at work out the method itself thi is true to some extent howev i do not think that our brain work like comput at all in fact there is substanti evid skarda 1985 skarda freeman 1987 that brain work more or less chaotic gener enough random for mental state to evolv our brain work much like genet algorithm gener i suppos the trick still ha to be there in some form to be discov doe thi mean that all the idea we will ever have ar alreadi pre program into our brain thi is somewhat unlik given that our brain ultim ar encod in 46 chromosom worth of genet materi much of which isn t us inde thi is extrem unlik given the vast impact of nurtur on our mind and brain i suggest howev that befor try to understand our conscious as a collect of algorithm kevin take a look at the refer i mention and think again i still think the best expert on the natur of a consciou mind ar neurologist neuropsychologist and biologist but do not flame me for my opinion sinc thei studi be that ar consciou the reason i am repeat my advic is that thi discuss cannot lead to anywher if our background ar too differ and pleas do not bring qm into thi discuss at all not all physicist ar happi with the claim that our conscious plai some special role in physic i would sai it doesn t the other problem with algorithm is their instabl not mani algorithm surviv if you take out a larg portion of their code yet peopl surviv stroke without go complet haywir there ar side effect but patient still seem remark stabl also neuron in perfectli healthi peopl ar dy at an alarm rate can an algorithm surviv if i randomli corrupt variou bit of it s code again _brain ar not comput_ don t forget thi thi doe not mean thei need someth els to work thei just work differ their primari purpos is percept and guidanc of action self awar and high intellig ar later appear the next problem is the sticki question of what is colour replac colour with the sensat of your choic presum the materialist viewpoint is that it s the product of some kind of chemic reaction the usual product of such a reaction ar energi differ chemic is colour a mixtur of these you ar still expect that we could find the idea of green in our brain somewher perhap in the form of some chemic thi is not how i see it the sensat green is a certain time depend pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex and it is distribut with the help of area v1 and v2 to the rest of the brain inde a fire pattern i have sometim thought of our conscious as a global free induct pattern of these local fire pattern but thi is just idl specul scientif american s septemb 1992 issu wa a special issu on mind and brain have you alreadi read it from cover to cover there ar two articl on visual percept so you might be interest but again pleas note that subject experi cannot be observ from a third person perspect if we see noth but neuron activ we cannot go on to conclud that thi is not the mind kalat 1988 write about numer exampl where electr stimul of differ area of brain have led to variou chang in the patient state of mind for instanc a patient whose septal area wa stimul without hi knowledg by remot control dure a psychiatr interview wa quickli cure of hi depress and start discuss a plan to seduc hi girlfriend stimul in the tempor lobe have sometim led to embarrass situat when the patient have start flirt with the therapist in conclus there is evid that 1 brain ar essenti necessari for subject experi brain damag is usual equival to some sort of mind damag 2 consciou process involv substanti brain activ in variou area of brain when we think of colour our visual cortex is activ etc 3 conscious is an afterthought we becom consciou of our action with a half a second delai and our brain ar ahead of our consciou will by at least 350 ms thu i think it is fruit to turn the question why do i see colour around and ask what is thi i that seem to be observ sinc it seem that our consciou mind is not the king of our brain if thi is so a comput won t see colour becaus the chemistri is differ doe an algorithm that see colour have a select advantag over an equival that doesn t it shouldn t becaus the output of each algorithm ought to be the same in equival circumst so why do we see colour thi depend on what is meant by see colour doe a neural network that is capabl of recognis handwritten number from 0 to 9 see the number if it is capabl of sort them if you ar ask why doe an anim who is consciou of itself as an observ have an evolutionari advantag over an anim who doesn t i have a good answer read my previou post where i wrote why a sens of ident help social anim to swap role and act more moral so that thei don t unconsci kill each other with newli discov weapon a bit extrem but thi is the basic idea when earli _homo_ becam more and more effici in us tool a sens of ident and the concept of self had to evolv in line with thi develop inde respect for other and consciou altruist behaviour might be evolutionari advantag for social anim such as earli human if i rememb correctli quantum mechan consist of a wavefunct with two process act on it the first process ha been call unitari evolut or u is govern by schroeding s equat and is well known the second process call variou thing such as collaps of the wavefunct or state vector reduct or r and is more mysteri it is usual said to occur when a measur take place although nobodi seem to know precis when that occur when it doe occur the effect of r is to abruptli chang the wavefunct if mind ar requir for thi doe thi mean that until human mind came to the scene wavefunct never collaps but remain in the superposit for aeon my how power we ar thi ha been discuss befor and i think thi topic is irrelev sinc we do not agre that mind ar necessari and neither do physicist anywai i m specul that mind would be in part x there seem to be some link between conscious and r in that we never see linear superposit of anyth although there ar altern explain for thi i ve no idea how a brain is suppos to access part x but sinc thi is onli specul that won t matter too much my main point is that there might be a place for mind in physic i agre but not in the sens you appar mean abov physic need sharp mind to solv mani real problem i ll go back to my nice pad cell now if that s
