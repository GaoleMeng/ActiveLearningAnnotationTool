here is how i modifi my quadra 700 for higher speed previous i had been us a variabl speed overdr for acceler my cpu but thi modif is test out as more stabl at higher speed your mileag mai vari the top speed you achiev cannot be predict befor hand my person q700 ha test fine up to 32 mhz thu far i didn t have higher speed clock oscil on hand to test higher speed part clock oscil 4 pin ttl varieti you will need a select of speed begin at 50 mhz on up the cpu will run at 1 2 the oscil speed the origin on is a 50 mhz unit i recommend get a 50 mhz clock in case you damag the exist on i obtain my clock oscil from digikei 1 800 344 4539 for less than $5 00 each some of their part number ar 50 mhz ttl clock oscil part x121 62 mhz ttl clock oscil part x136 66 mhz ttl clock oscil part ctx137 don t get the half size clock oscil thei won t fit there ar also cmo clock oscil i haven t tri on in a quadra thei work fine in iisi s socket obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as a 14 pin dip packag altern us 4 machin socket pin from an augat style socket just cut them out of the socket cool fan a veri small 12 volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a must my vso came with a special modifi heatsink which had a fan built onto it it had a pass through connector which tap into the hard drive power cabl you should rig up someth similar or risk fry your cpu procedur 1 insert usual disclaim and antistat warn here 2 remov the top lid of the machin you will see the floppi disk and hard drive mount in a plastic tower follow the usual anti static precaut and of cours make sure the machin is off when you do thi unplug all cabl wall and monitor power suppli cord from the back of the mac 3 remov the power suppli by pull the plastic interlock tab on the tower forward and simultan pull the power suppli straight up the tab is a piec of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extend downward to hook on to the power suppli you mai also feel a horsesho shape piec at the right portion of the power suppli leav that alon the plastic tab from the tower is all you need releas 4 look at the rear of the tower assembl you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cabl and a flat ribbon cabl lead to the floppi drive disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cabl connector ha a tab which must be squeez to releas it 5 unplug the drive activ led from it clear plastic mount 6 look down the posterior cylindr section of the plastic tower a phillip head screw is at the base remov it take care not to drop it into the case a bit of gummi glue on your screwdriv is help here 7 remov the tower assembl by pull medial the plastic tab on the right side of the tower thi tab prevent the tower from slide posteriorli slide the entir tower assembl 1 cm posteriorli then lift the tower assembl straight up and out of the case 8 remov the interrupt switch assembl it is a strang shape plastic devic at the left front edg of the motherboard pull the middl rear plastic prong up and forward the entir devic will releas 9 unplug the speaker cabl squeez the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backward to free it from the case 10 remov the motherboard form the case lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm thi allow it to clear the clear plastic power light guid slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm the motherboard then come directli out 11 locat the 50 mhz clock crystal it is a small metal box near the cpu chip note and rememb it orient the new clock oscil must be align with pin 1 in the same orient veri carefulli desold and remov the old clock oscil some of the pin mai be bent over simpli desold then unbend them be sure your desold iron is hot enough befor heat the board i us a suction desold iron to accomplish thi task thi is not appropri for a first solder experi the motherboard is a multi layer design with veri fine trace easili damag without proper care 12 instal your socket or socket pin where the old oscil onc wa 13 put a 50 mhz clock oscil into the new socket you could us the old clock but it ha solder on it pin thi mai come of insid the socket and caus corros problem later i suggest us a new 50 mhz clock 14 instal your cool fan system to complet the modif 14 reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place 15 snap in the interrupt switch assembl and speaker to lock the mother board firmli plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard 16 reinstal the tower assembl by first place the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembl about 1 cm posterior of it intend posit lower the tower assembl into place while maintain contact with the right wall of the case onc fulli down slide the tower assembl anteriorli until it click into place 17 reconnect the motherboard end of the cabl dont t forget the floppi drive cabl 18 replac the phillip head screw 19 drop the power suppli straight down into place until it click in 20 plug the hard drive activ light back into it clear plastic mount 21 reattach your cabl and power cord cross your finger and turn on the mac it should make the usual power on chord if it doesn t someth is amiss immedi turn of the power and recheck your handiwork if all is not well you have my sincer condol hopefulli all will work normal turn the machin back off and replac the 50 mhz clock oscil with a faster on reboot and be astound you will need to fulli test the machin for mani hour befor decid a particular speed is truli usabl with my vso a machin lock up might take 8 hour of oper to occur in the brief time sinc modifi my clock oscil 36 hour i have not had a singl problem good luck to all who attempt thi modif there is a small but real risk but you could well reach quadra 950 speed or higher with less than $50 in part gui kuo guykuo u washington edu
