in articl 1993apr7 141930 29582 freenet carleton ca ac002 freenet carleton ca nikolau maack write come on a gun kill peopl rather peopl kill peopl with gun the sad truth is sometim that is good or at least better than the altern but let s ignor gun for defenc and or crime and look at gun accid ok there ar about 1400 fatal firearm accid per year 1 and the number ha been in declin sinc earli thi centuri 2 most of these accid involv rifl or shot gun not handgun but serious a gun is design to fire a bullet thi is not so you can shoot cardboard cut out down at the rang in fact there ar both gun and bullet design specif for that the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel a semi auto 0 22 calib handgun wa design to kill or hurt peopl even for self defens would i m sure come as a surpris to it design it certainli isn t why i have it it certainli would hurt someon if you shot them with it and might even kill them but it is simpli wrong to sai it wa design to kill peopl thi is not design to act as a tool for home defenc where you show someon that you have a gun and thei go gee perhap i should leav in fact that is what happen most of the time most self defens us of firearm don t involv fire ani shot most crimin would prefer not to be shot and will go to some effort not to be includ do what you sai when you point a gun at them if you were call on to design a tool that could be easili carri to immedi stop someon attack you what would it be a handgun is about the best anyon ha come up with and experi show it doe work the best 3 no you see the gun wa design to fire that littl bullet into a human bodi and hurt them not a tough concept to swallow for most certainli no on argu that handgun of the type we ar discuss aren t deadli weapon howev it simpli isn t true to sai that all of them were design to kill peopl moreov what exactli is wrong with have deadli weapon there ar time when it is perfectli legitim to us deadli forc e g in self defens i consid it not just my right but my duti to defend myself and my famili and that includ have and know how to us the tool to do that the strongest reason for the peopl to retain the right to keep and bear arm is as a last resort to protect themselv against tyranni in govern t jefferson i think what jefferson said is still true and the troubl with have such an item is often the littl bullet goe off into the wrong fleshi target not veri often compar to other us 3 or els uncl frank get piss and blow awai hi wife thi isn t that common either at least when compar to other us it is veri rare that a non violent person will suddenli get piss and kill someon gun or not in most case the peopl who murder have long histori of violenc if you have good reason to believ that these peopl wouldn t kill if thei didn t have a gun feel free to present it have a thing specificli design to kill mean it is much easier to kill thing right right but there ar time when kill thing is call for i hope i never have to shoot a person but i ve had to kill a number of anim from rodent to cow and when i do i don t want them to suffer ani more than is necessari i prefer thei die instantli but fail that i want them to drop so i can quickli finish them with the next shot and fail that i don t want them to go fast or far i try to choos the best weapon and ammunit i have to try to achiev that goal for the size of anim i m after but it doesn t alwai work as i plan without belabor the point peopl who ar overli impress with the kill or shop power of gun particularli handgun haven t us them much for that purpos 1 accident death in 1988
