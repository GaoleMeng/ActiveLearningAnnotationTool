islam law if someon tell me islam sai such and such i immedi sai show me the support for thi statement from the qur an and sunnah i believ thi to be my islam duti for accord to on hadith of the prophet peac and bless of god be with him if your leader tell you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sin for do wrong even though you were _blindli_ follow the instruct of your leader _i_ am respons for my own action not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindli follow the opinion of abu hanifa etc with thi in mind to my understand we must look at the reason behind such opinion of muslim that support khomeini s fatwa now to my understand the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relat to a particular instanc that occur dure war time now brother in gener it is imho ridicul and wrong to sai that a hadith relat to the action of war is usabl dure time of peac i think ani sensibl human be can see thi so i person think that the reason of some of our ulema in thi matter is faulti for thei think it is legitim to us act of war in time of peac regard thi particular subject if you think i am wrong pleas feel free to sai so _with your reason from qur an and hadith_ pleas not becaus somebodi said so i want the reason from al qur an and the sahih hadith perhap we should take our discuss to soc religion islam pleas email me rashid if you think we should do thi by the wai i also disagre with your opinion regard the punish for apostasi the viewpoint i follow that there is in gener no punish for apostasi is _veri_ strongli support by qur an and hadith thi is veri well shown in the book punish in islam law by moham s el awa american trust public 1981 i reiter that i would agre with you that there is littl justif for the punish of apostasi in the qur an in islam histori as well apostasi ha rare been punish belief is consid a matter of conscienc and sinc there is to be no compuls in the matter of belief apost have been gener left to believ or not believ as thei will howev when an apost make attack upon god and hi messeng the situat chang now the charg of apostasi mai be complic with other charg perhap charg of sedit treason spy etc if the person make a public issu of their apostasi or mount public attack as oppos to arguement against islam the situat is likewis complic if the person spread slander or broadcast falsehood again the situat chang the punish vari accord to the situat the apost is in anyhow the charg of aggrav apostasi would onli be a subsidiari charg in rushdi s case there is a distinct in the qur an between a formal war situat and be in the situat where someon unilater wage war by their action creat disord make mischief etc against the muslim and creat a situat that result in harm to muslim here a small group or even a singl individu could be said to be engag in such a practis in other word there is a clear differ between a formal war situat where two clearli defin parti wage war conclud treati exchang prison etc and deal with attack that come from isol individu or group against islam it is the second situat the unilater attack and the spread of fasad that would appli in the case of rushdi the matter of rushdi is not a simpl matter of ban an offens book ban the book is secondari a full set of circumst follow the public of the book come into plai as well includ the death of mani muslim and rushdi s and hi publish media game now i do not believ in _blindli_ follow anyon no matter how knowledg he or she mai be in islam law if someon tell me islam sai such and such i immedi sai show me the support for thi statement from the qur an and sunnah i believ thi to be my islam duti for accord to on hadith of the prophet peac and bless of god be with him if your leader tell you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sin for do wrong even though you were _blindli_ follow the instruct of your leader _i_ am respons for my own action not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindli follow the opinion of abu hanifa etc now to my understand the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relat to a particular instanc that occur dure war time now brother in gener it is imho ridicul and wrong to sai that a hadith relat to the action of war is usabl dure time of peac i think ani sensibl human be can see thi so i person think that the reason of some of our ulema in thi matter is faulti for thei think it is legitim to us act of war in time of peac regard thi particular subject i am not sure which hadith you ar refer to abov i believ that on of the qur anic vers on which the fatwa is base is 5 33 everi vers in the qur an ha a correspond circumst of revel but in no wai is the understand the tafsir of the vers restrict sole to the particular histor circumst in which it wa reveal if thi wa the case then we could sai that all the law and regul that were reveal when the muslim were not involv in conflict should be suspend when thei were at war the logic doe not follow in complex real life situat there mai be mani vers and mani hadith which can all be relat to a singl complic situat the intern relationship between these vers mai be quit complex such that arriv at an understand of how the vers interlock and how each appli to the particular situat can be quit a demand task it is not necessarili a simpl thi or that process there mai be mani paramet involv there mai be a larger context in which a particular situat should be view all these matter imping on the situat in other word there is a great deal involv in deciph the qur an the qur an ask us to reflect on it vers but thi reflect must entail more than simpli read a vers and it correspond hadith if the reflect is for the sake of increas person pieti then each person ha hi own level of understand and there is no harm in that howev if the reflect is in order to decid matter that pertain to the state to the gestat of law and rule to the gestat of societi the dispens of justic the guidanc of the commun then there ar certain minimum requir of understand that on should achiev jaffar ibn muhammad as sadiq a s relat some of these requir as taught by the prophet s a in a hadith he who doe not distinguish in the book of allah the abrog vers from the abrog on and a specif on from a gener on and a decis from an ambigu and doe not differenti between a permiss and an oblig and doe not recogn a vers of meccan period from a medinit on and doe not know the circumst of revel and doe not understand the technic word of the qur an whether simpl or compound and doe not comprehend the knowledg of decre and measur and is ignor of advanc and delai in it vers and doe not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoter nor the begin from the termin and is unawar of the question and the answer the disjoin and the join and the except and the all inclus and is ignor of an adject of a preced noun that explain the subsequ on and is unawar of the emphas subject and the detail on the obligatori law and the permiss the place of the duti and rule and the mean of the law and the unlaw and doe not know the join word and the word that ar relat to those come befor them or after them then such a man doe not know the qur an nor is he among the peopl of the qur an base on these and other hadith and in accord with mani qur anic vers why should not a compani from everi group remain behind to gain profound understand tafaqquh in religion and to warn peopl when thei return to them so that thei mai bewar 9 122 a scienc of jurisprud aros the requir for a person to be consid a mujtahid on who can pronounc on matter of law and religion ar mani i ve list a few major divis below there ar of cours mani subdivis within these head knowledg of arab syntax conjug root semant oratori knowledg of tafsir and principl of tafsir logic mantiq a knowledg of hadith a knowledg of transmitt rijal knowledg of the principl

principl of option principl of masteri the jurisprud is bound to go through a veri rigor process in pronounc judgement on a given situat it is not a matter of look at on vers and on hadith now no on should blindli follow anyon but there is a differ between blind follow and acced to the opinion of someon who is clearli more knowledg and more qualifi than oneself there is the famou hadith of the prophet s a in which he sai the fuqaha religi scholar ar the truste of the prophet as long as thei do not concern themselv with the illicit desir pleasur and wealth of thi world the prophet s a wa ask o messeng of god how mai we know if thei so concern themselv he s a repli by see whether thei follow the rule power if thei do that fear for your religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imam of the four sunni madhab to comment on how thi hadith appli to them or to the contemporari scholar who base themselv upon them the prophet also refer to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam my onli point is to make it clear that arriv at a legal judgement call into plai a certain amount of expertis the specif of thi expertis is delin in the qur an and hadith those who acquir thi expertis ar prais in both the qur an and hadith those who without the requisit knowledg pronounc on matter that affect societi state and religion ar caution the onli reason i said anyth at all about the rushdi affair in thi group is becaus the whole basi for the discuss of the fatwa that is apostasi wa wrong when on discuss someth thei should at least base their discuss on fact secondli khomeini wa condemn as a heret becaus he supposedli claim to be infal anoth instanc of creat a straw man and then beat him perhap we should take our discuss to soc religion islam pleas email me rashid if you think we should do thi i agre that we should move the discuss to anoth newsgroup unfortun i do not have ani access to email so privat discuss or a moder group is out of the question i cannot post to a moder group like soc religion islam how about soc cultur arab or talk religion misc as salaam a laikum
