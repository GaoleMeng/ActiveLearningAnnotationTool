prescod write i m not i m in canada we have far fewer shoot like thi we have had i believ on mass murder in the last twenti year i m not go to sai we don t have our gun problem but we do have the world s largest undefend boarder with on of the most gun happi countri in the world i think canada illustr that gun control doe have an effect in fact it s supris that there is ani differ consid how easi it is to smuggl a gun from the u s ye it s amaz isn t it in fact it should tell you that gun control is not the reason your crime rate is low sinc ani idiot can smuggl gun into canada from the us at ani time i think paul wa try to make the point that ani idiot doesn t there ar sure some idiot who do smuggl gun but paul seem to feel that the exi tenc of stricter gun control law ha had a deterr effect thi seem a strang argument to make consid that canada s violent crime rate in gener is far lower than that of the u s our non gun crime rate is greater than their entir crime rate it would seem strang to suggest that it to were the result of gun control law i think if we look we d find veri specif cultur and enforc reason why the non gun rate is low as well and then that reason could be appli to the with gun rate as easili given that most crimin us gun ar either legal purchas or stolen from those who purchas them legal have more restrict on legal possess doe seem to have the effect of reduc gun relat crime asid from the fact that i find the idea of be punish becaus somebodi might steal someth from me and go and commit a crime with it a silli solut it still doesn t address the question of canada which is now by the wai blame their rise gun crime rate on the u s strang that the border us to magic keep the gun out but now isn t it certainli make sens that it would well it make sens to some of us anywai the other side of the coin of cours is that far illeg drug ar purchas legal or stolen from peopl who purchas them legal i ve still not been convinc that gun a commod which crimin have shown their perfectli will to pai for from illeg sourc stolen either from polic militari or civilian we wouldn t simpli see south american sourc from which drug come start smuggl gun as well sinc there s a thrive gun manufactur industri down there if you would just look a littl closer at the crime statist you would realiz that our non gun crime rate is also veri high so gun per se ar not the issu directli contradict by the nejm studi that compar crime in seattl and vancouv b c the non gun rate were roughli the same for both citi the differ in violent crime rate wa almost total gun relat and as wa not point out in the studi but in critiqu of it two seper articl by jame wright and david kopel come to mind it wa point out that the differ wa also almost entir minor relat that is the gun crime rate skyrocket for poor minor black and hispan primarili while when you compar the white major thei were virut ident the problem with the nejm studi wa thei compar minor vs non minor percentag but fail to take into account the rel condit of those minor that there wa an eqaul percentag of nomn white wa about as far as thei went thei fail to take into account that the non white in either citi were not live in the same condit if the situat wa entir base on avail of gun then we d expect that the white rate the two group which ar arguabl fairli compar in the two citi would have a far higher rate in seattl yet the major in seattl is not onli not significantli higher when the minor ar exclud but slightli lower violent crime is highli concentr in the inner citi surpris pick the area with the highest incid of poverti drug us diseas etc sinc rate ar lower in suburbia us middl class folk can ignor the problem the point is of cours that mani of the u s inner citi problem ar not mirror in canada as such if there is a condit which is significantli differ in canada from the u s and violent crime is highli correl to that area suggest that gun control is the sourc of canada s low rate is highli question as on canadian point out on talk polit gun canada s major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduct or a slow of an increas in violent crime rate which have been rise steadili sinc appar thei didn t even mirror the u s s veri larg drop of violent crime in the earli eighti most violent crime occur in area with strict gun control alreadi post hoc ergo propter hoc those area implement gun control becaus of the high rate true onli to a certain extent take washington d c where gun control wa institut while it had crime problem true but that crime proceed to explod afterward similarli for new york the question is not simpli a point in time where crime wa high or low did the gun control significantli and posit impact violent crime sinc it s gone up in those area often faster than it wa go up befor you can t simpli dismiss the high crime rate by sai gun control wa caus by it ye gun control mai be institut to deal with high crime but if the crime is not posit impact you can t continu sai that that crime rate wa entir a caus of that gun control sinc much of that crime rate increas after gun control wa implement just as happen in canada similar or wors rate exist in citi with poor gun control as would be expect if violent crime wa gener independ of gun control and the juri is still out on the question of whether recent tough law in washington d c mai have allevi violenc and suicid rate there would thi be the law which made manufactur liabl for what other did with their gun and suddenli the polic found nobodi would sell to them david veal
