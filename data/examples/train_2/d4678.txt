write add to thi the outrag cost of put someon to death special cell block year of court cost extra guard and the benefit of the death penalti entir disappear that s becaus of your earlier claim that the on innoc death overrid the benefit of all the other obvious it s tragic but it is no argument for do awai with the death penalti if we went to war and worri about accident kill civilian all of the time becaus our determin of who the enemi realli is is imperfect then there is no wai to win the war ye fortun we have right think folk like your good self in power and it wa therefor deem accept to slaughter ten or even hundr of thousand of iraqi in order to liber oil h h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death were wai over exagger and exploit for anti war emotion by the liber new media the fact ar that less iraqi di in the gulf war than did civilian in ani other war of compar size thi centuri thi wa due mostli to the short durat coupl with precis surgic bomb techniqu which were technic possibl onli recent the idea that hundr of thousand of iraqi citizen di is ludicr not even hundr of thousand of iraqi soldier di and thei were the on be target or do you think that the us and it alli were specif out to kill and maim iraqi civilian either the smart bomb didn t hit their target and we know thei did or thei were target civilian target which is hardli condus to destroi iraq s militari potenti the militari mission planner ar not fool thei know thei have to hit militari target to win a war hit civilian target doe noth but unit the peopl against you not a laudabl goal if on want the peopl to rise up against their tyrant dictat ok so some innoc peopl di ye mayb the unarm civilian flee along that road didn t need to be bomb to bit perhap that kid with half hi face burn off and the littl girl with the mangl leg weren t entir guilti but it s worth the death of a few innoc to save the oil h h hlive of the kuwaiti peopl isn t it after all the iraqi mai not have had a chanc to vote for saddam but thei show their accept of hi regim by not assassin him right all that surrend and flee along open road wa just a deviou ploi we were entir within our right to bomb em just in case without find out if thei were soldier how about all the innoc peopl who di in blanket bomb in ww2 i don t hear you bemoan them war is never an exact scienc but with smart bomb it s becom more exact with a smaller percentag of civilian casualti sometim mistak ar made target ar misidentifi innoc die that s war the wai it realli is but the altern to allow tyrann dictat to treat the earth like it s on big rummag sale grab everyth thei can get is wors like patrick henri said some 217 year ago i know not what cours other mai take but as for me give me liberti or give me death war is alwai the price on must be will to pai if on wish to stai free the death penalti wa conceiv as a deterr to crime but the legal shenanigan that have been ad automat appeal lengthi court battl etc have releg that purpos to a veri small part of what it should be henc the question is do we instat the death penalti as it wa meant to be and see if that deter crime or do we get rid of it entir ye let s reinstat the death penalti the wai it ought to be all that shit about fair trial and a court of appeal just get in the wai of justic let s give the polic the absolut right to gun down the guilti and save ourselv the expens of all those lawyer think of the knock on benefit too la would never have had to spend so much monei clean up after riot and hold showcas trial if the cop had been allow to do their job properli a quick bullet through the head of rodnei king and anoth for the cameraman and everyon would have been save a great deal of unnecessari paperwork and expens after all if the polic decid a man s guilti that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalti ha been shown not to have ani deterr effect over imprison well that s entir irrelev mathew mathew your sarcasm is note but you ar complet off base here you come off sound like a complet peac nik idiot although i feel sure that wa not your intent so the iraqi war wa wrong eh i m sure that appeas would have work better than war just like it did in ww2 eh i guess we shouldn t have fought ww2 either just think of all those innoc german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who di in the crossfir becaus we invad the contin we should have just let hitler take over europ and you d be speak german instead of english right now tyrant like hussein have to be stop hi kind don t understand diplomaci thei onli understand the point of a gun my onli regret is that bush wimp out and didn t have the militari roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peopl s sacrific not to mention the 357 american who di wa for naught liber kuwait wa a good thing but wipe hussein off the map would ve been better and as for poor poor rodnei king did you ever stop and think why the juri in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilti those who have been foam at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainli have look no further than the video tape but the juri look at all the evid evid which you and i have not seen when on make a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evid can be present on both side on ha simpli lower himself to the level of vigilant justic a state of mind which your sarcasm abov seemingli spoke against but instead tend to support in the case against the policemen law in thi countri is intend to protect the right of the accus whether thei be crimin or cop on is not found guilti if there is a reason doubt of on s guilt and onli the juri is in a posit to assess the evid and render a verdict anyon els is simpli succumb to verbal vigilant regard jim b
