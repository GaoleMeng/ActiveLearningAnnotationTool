i have never work with realli small signal befor and have a few question about low level nois i have notic that the waveform synthes that i am us analog 2020 ha some rel larg common mode nois on it i am us thi synthes to null out anoth transient waveform and am amplifi the differ 200uv sever hundr time the 2020 ha about 1 3 mvp p of common mode nois and thi tend to make my measur hard to repeat the nois is not quit in sync with line frequenc and on a spectrum analyz the main compon is about 64hz how can i get rid of the nois when i look at the spectrum us an hp 3582a audio rang analyz the nois goe awai the minut i switch to isol on the input i am guess the anlayz ha a diff amp on the input sinc it will read accur down to dc also if i us a differenti amplifi ia to solv the problem how import is it to us on of these shield driver an amp connect to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remov troubl caus by differ cabl capacit if anyon can suggest a good ic ia for us with transient signal with content from 1khz to about 300khz i would appreci it
