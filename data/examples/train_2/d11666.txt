nagl netcom com john nagl write great explain howev you left off on detail why do you alwai see them at nuclear plant but not alwai at fossil fuel plant at nuclear plant it is prefer to run the water close cycl wherea fossil fuel plant can in some case get awai with dump the hot water as i recal the water isn t as hot thermodynam in mani fossil fuel plant and of cours there is less danger of radioact contamin actual the reason you don t see so mani cool tower at fossil plant ar 1 fossil unit multipl unit per plant ar gener smaller than nuclear plant 300 mwe seem to be a veri popular size when mani fossil plant were built the averag nuclear plant is 1000 mwe 2 mani fossil plant were grandfath when water discharg regul were adopt why those old dirt burner can t harm anyth let em go 3 power draft cool tower low enough to the ground to be gener not visibl from off site ar quit popular with fossil plant 4 fossil plant us to get much less regulatori attent than nuclear actual fossil fuel plant run hotter than the usual boil water reactor nuclear plant there s a gripe in the industri that nuclear power us 1900 vintag steam technolog so it s more import in nuclear plant to get the cold end of the system as cold as possibl henc big cool tower oil and ga fire steam plant also have condens but thei usual ar size to get the steam back into hot water not most of the wai down to ambient some plant do cool the condens with water rather than air as on canadian offici ask about thermal pollut de ic a river said up here we view heat as a resourc actual the condens environ is essenti the same for plant of similar size the issu ar the same regardless of where the heat come from condens ar run at as high a vacuum as possibl in order to reduc aerodynam drag on the turbin the condens pressur is normal water s vapor pressur at the condens temperatur it is desir that the steam exhaust be free of water droplet becaus moistur in the steam caus sever eros damag to the turbin low pressur blade and becaus entrain water move at high veloc caus eros of the condens tube the coldest and thu lowest pressur condens environ is alwai the best a relat issu is that of pump the condens from the hotwel where the water end up after drip off the condens tube sinc the condens is at a veri low pressur the onli forc drive the condens into the hotwel pump is graviti if the condens is too hot or the graviti head is too low the condens will reflash into steam bubbl and caus the condens pump to cavit thi is a particularli destruct form of cavit that is to be avoid at all cost the hotwel pump ar locat in the lowest point in the plant in order to provid a graviti head to the pump how much lower thei must be is a function of how hot the water is allow to get in the hotwel typic hotwel temperatur run between 100 and 120 degre depend on the temperatur of the river water thi term is us to describ the river grade water even when the cool tower system is oper in close loop mode and essenti no river water is pump when the river water temperatur is high in the summer oper will typic allow the hotwel level to rise in order to provid more graviti head there is a tradeoff involv sinc higher hotwel level will encroach onto the condens tube and reduc the condens area at least in the east and elsewher where moistur actual exist in the air the river water will almost alwai be cooler than the discharg water from the cool tower the temperatur of the discharg water from the cool tower is set by the ambient air temperatur and humid it is veri rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatur exceed 70 degre a vast differ from the typic 95 95 dai 95 degre 95% humid we see routin in the east it is not unusu particularli where the econazi have been success in clamp rigid discharg water temperatur limit on a plant for the plant to have to reduc the fire rate when the air temperatur get too high and the condens cannot handl the heat load without excess pressur everybodi run close cycl boiler the water us is purifi of solid which otherwis crud up the boiler plumb when the water boil purifi water for boiler us is a bigger job than cool it so the boiler water is recycl true actual secondari plant the part that make electr and feed feedwat to the boiler water chemistri ha been the bastard stepchild until recent and ha not gotten the respect it deserv the plant chemist have just in the past decad or so fulli understood the cost of impur water by impur i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conduct and or a few ppm of dissolv oxygen secondari water is now typic the most pure on will find outsid the laboratori john john de armond wd4oqc interest in high perform mobil perform engin magazin tm interest in high tech and comput marietta ga send ur snail mail address to jgd dixi com perform dixi com for a free sampl mag lee harvei oswald where ar ya when we need ya
