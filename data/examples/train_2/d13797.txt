i would appreci ani thought on what make a planet habit for human i am make asumpt that life and a similar atmospher evolv given a rang of physic aspect of the planet the question is what physic aspect simpli disallow earth like condit thi is a good question there ar major blind spot in our understand of what make the earth habit for exampl why doe the earth s atmospher have the concentr of oxygen it doe the naiv answer is photosynthesi but thi is clearli incomplet photosynthesi by itself can t make the atmospher oxygen as the oxygen produc is consum when the plant decai or ar eaten what is need is photosynthesi plu some mechan to sequest some fraction of the result reduc materi on earth thi mechan is burial in seafloor sediment of organ matter mostli from ocean sourc howev thi burial requir continent sediment in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow that most materi is consum befor it can be sequest thi suggest that a planet without larg ocean or a planet without contin undergo weather will have a hard time accumul an oxygen atmospher in particular an all ocean planet mai have a hard time support an oxygen atmospher there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth s atmospher ha been rel stabl over geolog time for a period at least 2 order of magnitud longer than the decai time of atmospher o2 to weather in the absenc of replenish no convinc feedback mechan ha been identifi perhap the reason is the weak anthrop principl if dure the last 500 myr or so the oxygen level had drop too low we wouldn t be here to be wonder about it paul f dietz dietz cs rochest edu
