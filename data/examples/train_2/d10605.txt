would wiretap chip be cost effect by robin hanson draft april 21 1993 summari compar to an averag monthli phone bill of sixti dollar wiretap ar onli worth two cent a month to polic so the propos wiretap chip must rais phone cost by less than on part in three thousand to be cost effect background until now phone have happen to allow the exist of wiretap detector which could pick up convers on a phone line and over time law enforc agenc have come to reli on thi capabl to aid in crimin investig howev power new encrypt technolog threaten thi statu quo by make possibl truli privat commun a small chip in each phone could soon make it liter imposs to overhear a convers without physic microphon at either end in order to preserv the abil of law enforc agenc to tap phone convers the u s govern announc on april 16 1993 that it had develop and begun manufactur a special wiretap chip to be place in futur phone instead of the total privaci chip which have been under privat develop the same dai at t announc it would us these chip in all it secur telephon product each chip would be creat under govern supervis when it would be given a fix indentifi and encrypt kei period dure each convers the chip would broadcast it identifi and other info in a special law enforc block law enforc offic with a court order could then obtain the kei correspond to the indentifi from special trust agenc and could therebi listen in on ani futur or previous record convers on that phone to date most concern voic about thi plan have been about it secur the govern won t disclos the encrypt algorithm and mani suspect the govern will not limit it access in the wai it ha claim the track record of previou govern doe not inspir confid on thi point 1 howev thi paper will neglect these concern and ask instead whether thi new wiretap chip is a cost effect tool for polic investig that is which is a cheaper wai for societi to investig crime forc phone commun to support wiretap or give polic agenc more monei to investig crime in other wai or to put it anoth wai would polic agenc be will to pai for each wiretap if thei had to pai their share of the full social cost of forc phone to support wiretap to start to answer thi question we might compar the current benefit wiretap provid to law enforc agenc with project cost of implement the new wiretap chip plan and sinc current benefit ar easier to estim we begin there wiretap benefit 1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statist ar avail 2 in that year 872 wiretap instal were request and no request were deni thi figur doe not includ wiretap obtain with the consent of a parti to the convers 2057 arrest result from wiretap start the same year 1486 arrest came from wiretap in previou year and 55% of arrest led to convict 76% of the wiretap were for phone vs pager email etc 60% were regard drug offens and 40% were request by feder author each wiretap instal heard an averag of 1487 call 22% of them incrimin among 131 peopl and cost an averag of $45 125 extrapol from the 794 instal report cost mostli for labor thu a total of about $40 million wa spent on wiretap to obtain about 4000 arrest at $10 000 per arrest thu these arrest ar at least four time more expens than the $2500 per arrest figur on get by divid the $28 billion spent by all polic nation by the total 11 million non traffic arrest 3 thu the $30 million per year spent on phone tap is onli on thousanth of the total polic expenditur and if we divid thi by the 138 million phone access line in the countri 3 we get about 23 cent spent per year per phone line or about two cent a month in gener we deter a given class of crimin through a combin of a perceiv probabl of be caught and convict and some expect punish level if convict so the social valu of have wiretap is no more than the amount that we would have to pai to get the same crimin deterr through other mean if unabl to wiretap a particular suspect s phone polic might instead us hidden microphon or investig that suspect in other wai or polic might focu on suspect more easili investig without wiretap or we might rais the fine or prison time for certain type of crime if we gener assum that these substitut for wiretap would be on averag twice as expens as wiretap then the annual social benefit of phone wiretap is about equal to the current spend level of two cent a month per phone line wiretap cost let us for the moment optimist assum that the us govern encrypt scheme is as secur as whatev privat enterpris would have offer instead protect our convers from the spy ear of neighbor corpor and govern both foreign and domest even so the need to support wiretap would add mani addit cost to build and maintain our commun system extra law enforc block would be ad to phone transmiss increas traffic by some unknown percentag a special process must be us to add encrypt kei to chip while secur distribut these kei to special agenc which must be fund and monitor the chip themselv ar design by a militari contractor whose design is to remain secret and ar manufactur through a special process so that the chip becom nearli imposs to take apart chip ar now offer at the rel high price of $30 a peic in lot of 10 000 4 privat encrypt system not support wiretap would requir none of these extra cost perhap most import govern degre would at least partial replac privat marketplac evolut of standard for how voic is to be repres encrypt and exchang in our futur phone it is wide believ that govern ar less effici than privat enterpris in procur product and standard though thei mai perhap perform a us broker role when we choos between compet privat standard how much less effici is a matter of debat some sai thei pai twice as much while other might sai onli 10% more current a total of $96 billion is spent as oper expens of u s phone compani 3 which come out to about $60 per month per access line if we compar thi to the wiretap valu of two cent per month we see that if wiretap rais averag oper cost by even as much as on part in 3000 then wiretap ar not cost effect and thi doesn t even includ extra cost phone owner pai becaus their encrypt chip ar more expens of cours most phone wouldn t have encrypt chip for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same so thi argument still appli conclus given thi dramat differ between the total cost of run the phone system and the valu of wiretap we can justifi onli the slightest modif of the phone system to accommod wiretap when the onli modif requir wa to allow investig in to attach clip to phone wire wiretap support mai have been reason but when we consid substanti modif the burden of proof is clearli on those propos such modif to show that the cost would realli be less than the benefit if consensu cannot be obtain on thi cost benefit estim a compromis might be to tax phone which do not support wiretap at a rate of sai five cent per month a tax payabl to polic agenc nationwid to compens them for their loss of wiretap abil 1
