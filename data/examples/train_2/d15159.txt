it troubl me that there have been so mani post recent try to support the doctrin of origin sin thi is primarili a cathol doctrin with no other purpos than to defend the idea of infant baptism even among it support howev peopl will stop short of sai that unbaptis infant will go to hell it s veri easi for just about anyon to come up with a partial list of scriptur to support ani sort of wrong doctrin howev if we have the heart to persever in our belief to make sure that thei ar biblic base then we can come to an understand of the truth let s now take a more complet look at scriptur colossian 2 11 12 in him you were also circumcis in the put off of the sin natur not with a circumcis done by christ have been buri with him in baptism and rais with him through your faith in the power of god who rais him from the dead in baptism we ar rais to a new life in christ roman 6 4 through a person faith in the power of god our parent s faith cannot do thi do infant have faith let s look at what the bibl ha to sai about it roman 10 16 17 but not all the israelit accept the good new for isaiah sai lord who ha believ our messag consequ faith come from hear the messag and the messag is heard through the word of christ so then we receiv god s gift of faith to us as we hear the messag of the gospel faith is a possibl respons to hear god s word preach kid ar not yet spiritu intellectu or emotion matur enough to respond to god s word henc thei cannot have faith and therefor cannot be rais in baptism to a new life ezekiel 18 20 the soul who sin will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteous of the righteou man will be credit to him and the wicked of the wick will be charg against him if you read all of ezekiel 18 you will see that god doesn t hold us guilti for anyon els s sin so we can have no origin guilt from adam ezekiel 18 31 32 rid yourselv of all the offens you have committ and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o hous of israel for i take no pleasur in the death of anyon declar the sovereign lord repent and live the wai to pleas god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit kid cannot do thi act 2 38 39 sai that when we repent and ar baptiz we will then receiv a new spirit the holi spirit then we shall live now then that we have a littl more background as to why origin sin is not biblic let s look at some of the scriptur us to support it roman 5 12 therefor just as sin enter the world through on man and death through sin and in thi wai death came to all men becaus all sin sin and death enter the world when the first man sin death came to each man becaus each man sin note that it s good to read through all of roman 5 12 21 some of the vers ar easier to misunderstand than other but if we read them in context we will see that thei ar all sai basic the same thing let s look at on such roman 5 19 for just as through the disobedi of the on man the mani were made sinner so also through the obedi of the on man the mani will be made righteou through the disobedi of each individu each wa made a sinner in the same wai through the obedi of jesu each will be made righteou we must rememb when read through thi passag that death came to each man onli becaus each man sin not becaus of guilt from adam otherwis the bibl would contradict itself i encourag you to read through thi whole passag on your own look at it from thi point of view to see if it doesn t all fit togeth psalm 51 5 sure i wa sin at birth sin from the time my mother conceiv me thi whole psalm is a wonder exampl of how we should humbl ourselv befor god in repent for sin david himself wa a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after commit adultri with bathsheba and murder her husband all that david is sai here is that he can t rememb a time when he wasn t sin he is humbl himself befor god by confess hi sin hi sai that he wa sin at birth is a hyperbol the bibl be inspir by god isn t limit to a liter interpet but also us figur of speech as did jesu john 16 25 for anoth exampl of hyperbol see luke 14 26 now then even though peopl see that baptism requir faith and that origin sin is not biblic thei will still argu that infant baptism is necessari becaus children sin by be selfish not share toi with other children by be mean hit other and fight etc certainli we have observ children do wrong thing but my gut feel is alwai that thei don t know ani better let s look to see if the bibl agre with my gut feel isaiah 7 14 15 therefor the lord himself will give you a sign the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him immanuel he will eat curd and honei when he know enough to reject the wrong and choos the right now just about ani church leader will tell you that thi is a propheci about jesu if thei don t then point them to matthew 1 23 and find a new leader jesu certainli couldn t have had less knowledg than normal human babi yet thi passag sai that he had to matur to a certain extent befor he would know the differ between right and wrong we see that he did grow and becom wiser in luke 2 40 and 2 52 the implic is that jesu did wrong thing as a child befor he knew to choos right over wrong sinc we know that jesu wa perfect without sin we have rather conclus proof that babi cannot sin becaus thei don t know to choos the right instead of the wrong jesu himself wa baptiz albeit with john s baptism not as an infant but as a thirti year old man luke 3 21 23 and start hi ministri as soon as he wa baptiz luke 3 23 immedi afterward he wa tempt by the devil luke 4 1 13 matthew 4 1 11 mark 1 12 13 thank you for your attent moder thi should finish up the subject for a while perhap you would like to make a faq out of thi respons so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic come up feel free to rearrang the content if you would like to but pleas send me a copi of the final faq sincer aaron cardena aaronc athena mit edu i think you re overli optimist about the authorit qualiti of your respons first origin sin is not a cathol onli doctrin it wa held by luther and calvin as well and is still present in on form or anoth in the lutheran and reform tradit second sai that it ha no other purpos than defend infant baptism is an ad hominem argument which ha consider evid against it the origin baptist theologi includ origin sin and some baptist still hold it and there ar certainli group that baptiz infant without believ in origin sin among protest the sacrament tend to be a bit more symbol than among cathol protest who baptiz infant see baptism as a sign of god s accept of us rather than our accept of god in tradit protest theologi god s grace preced our respons and is applic to children there ar a number of passag on can cite to indic that god accept even children clh
