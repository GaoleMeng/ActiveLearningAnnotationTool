sketch rotat so cylind axi is z axi intersect x y project of line with project cylind similar to but easier than sphere intersect result no intersect on intersect or two intersect parameter along line by t0 and t1 now look at z and comput intersect of line with top and bottom plane of cylind thi give t0 and t1 the interv of intersect is then the bit of the line from t0 t1 intersect t0 t1 detail left as an exercis for the reader s spencer w thoma
