note i m not post thi as part of an argument with roger meynard but as an independ sort of thread i do actual quot some thing that roger meynard wrote but it might be better to think of thi as sampl hi post in the hip hop sens becaus it fit in with what i want to sai maynard ramsei cs laurentian ca roger maynard write but the point is that the onli decis make pro cess us to determin the best is the score of the game and it re late to the team not the individu player there is no method inher in basebal of compar individu perform and that is how it should be becaus after all basebal is a team game there s an interest parallel between thi wai of view a basebal team and some peopl s concept of a biolog organ in the biologi context we would veri like read fit for the score of the game and organ for team how we interpret player is trickier but either organ or gene might seem reason choic depend on what point we were try to make a gene interpret actual might be realli interest in thi case but that would be a differ and probabl longer post if howev we take the organ view then our knowledg of biologi should make us paus befor we start sai thing like speci x is more fit than speci y becaus of a better organ z given what we know about the interdepend of organ we would often be suspici of such claim but note that thi type of argument is quit often made when you map speci x onto human and organ z onto brain on the other hand some statement of thi kind do seem more reason than other as far as we can test them e g brain abov might be more reason than pancrea assum no gross patholog particularli if speci y is a primat even when you make such statement you should be concern with the function of the whole organ and the possibl that on organ might be more crucial for on speci and a second organ in anoth not to mention the possibl that no organ is particularli crucial in some third speci howev if we ar non vitalist with ani kind of reductionsit streak we will want to sai that an organ is not some complet magic unanalyz whole but an intrigu process made up of variou subprocess that interact in wai that ar potenti observ some of these process might be local to particular organ while other mai be distribut across multipl organ in a wai thi is just like a basebal team except that i think it is pretti clear that the process and interact involv in basebal ar much simpler and less numer than in most organ to sai that on player is better than anoth is to be abl to sai ab solut that player a s team would have plai better with player b in their lineup sheer specul imposs to ascertain on thing that is quit difficult about basebal is that perfectli control experi ar sometim veri tough to do but of cours thi ha never stop research from do the best thei can and sometim deriv veri power conclus even in the absenc of certainti most of thi goe far beyond sheer specul but even sheer specul can motiv further interest research if you want to select a group of statist and claim that clemen ha done better than anoth pitcher with those statist as a criteria then fine in thi case we re see the word statist mean summari of observ event where the event themselv can be view as the output of some process and possibl input for other process thu if we have ani valid notion of how the process ar put togeth into the function organ data in the form of statist might give us a basi to test particular hypothes but you have to be abl to prove that those statist measur the individu s contribut to win the ws becaus that is the onli measur of best that ha ani mean in the context of basebal thi statement bring us back to the concept of fit again fit is defin in term of both an organ and it environ you might be fit in on situat and not anoth move to basebal it is clear that each team spend the entir season in an environ includ all the other team in the leagu in at least a nomin sens the divis winner ar the fittest team in the leagu in that thei on averag had better fit score than ani of their compet opponennt but in a real sens there is a fairli larg random compon in the perform of each team that is difficult if not imposs to account for in term of factor intrins to or interest for basebal the same is true in biologi but here is also no direct biolog equival of the world seri in baseb in the world seri the random compon mai be greatli magnifi by the small number of game that ar plai and both team suddenli experi huge chang from the environ where thei were origin success it might be fun to watch but it s unclear what it all realli mean now just on more un relat point i have yet to see that ani of you can predict a ws winner with ani greater accuraci than jeann dixon on the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the outcom of the division race better than a random assign of team to finish and mayb some of us e g me who can do thi better than the other particip in thi forum on a regular basi but thi is probabl onli due to the fact that a 162 game schedul give you a littl hope that bad hop aren t the onli differ between the winner and the loser moreov you ve had the opportun to see some analysi of the world seri situat that make the strong claim that nobodi can predict the ws winner with reliabl greater accuraci than a coin bias onli to reflect the well known home vs road effect on win percentag the stat ar a nice hobbi and that s about it there is no new knowledg be produc sinc stat ar summari of event it s true that if you know the event you can deriv the stat but if somebodi is try to understand the process behind the stat then the stat produc new knowledg and some of thi might even be reliabl repeat and us speak of which i should get back to produc knowledg in a differ field that is of cours if i can produc knowledg even though i m reli on stat to do it jking
