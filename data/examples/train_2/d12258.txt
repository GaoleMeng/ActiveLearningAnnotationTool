neal cmptrc lonestar org neal howard write the concret floor acceler the problem becaus it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid batteri self discharg at a slightli faster rate that s why the old wive tale of sit it on a piec of wood on the floor work to help keep from kill the batteri as fast it insul the batteri thermal it you ll set the batteri down on a piec of styrofoam it will self discharg even slower there ar a number of inaccuraci here 1 in fact a colder batteri will self discharg more slowli thi is why batteri should be store in a cool dry place 2 an batteri place on concret doe not becom colder than on place on wood the batteri the wood and the concret will all be at the same gener temperatur ignor temperatur fluctuat and thu none will effect the other the best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volum turn down low and leav it on constantli but also trickl charg it everi coupl dai too to shallow cycl the charg in the batteri such mild exercis of a lead acid batteri is the next best thing to complet remov the electrolyt for storag there is no need to exercis the batteri just keep it charg a trickl charger will do the job stuff delet
