in articl cmm 0 90 2 734911642 thomasp surt ifi uio no thoma parsli thomasp ifi uio no write overal crime rate it fell just like that two question when wa thi and do you have the relev number pleas note thi is not in ani wai an indic i don t believ you or that you re not correct but when the drop occur is relev acquir weapon in norwai you can bui almost all kind of weapon in norwai but you must have a permit and a good reason to get the permit if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licenc from the polic and to be a member of a gun club the primari object beyond on base on the ideal of rkba that it is simpli not someth the govern should do is that it make gun a plai thing and tool of the rich and connect it discrimin against the poor is self defens consid appropri and if so under what condit ar you allow for instanc to get a gun for protect if you re go to be carri a veri larg sum of monei on a regular basi or have been threaten the polic would check my crimin record for ani seriou crime and or record of seriou mental diseas thi ha been suggest in the u s and gener support among gun owner what mani object to is that mani if not most propos contain a sort of gotcha claus which allow an arbitrari denial even if you qualifi in everi wai now if a got my licenc i would have to be an activ member of the gun club for 6 month befor i could collect my gun it s a littl like get a driver licenc isn t it you have to prove that you can drive befor you ar allow to at thi point it should be point out that in gener a driver s licenc in the u s is for the most part noth like it european counterpart i understand get on is far more difficult there than here in the u s it s a joke but my usual object is that you re discuss two differ thing for instanc in the u s a driver s licens is a permit to oper a motor vehicl on a public road it is not necessari to own on or to oper it on privat properti that is the abil to requir drive permit is gener consid to aris from the govern s legitim power to enact reason regul for behavior on public land a permit to own an automobil for instanc which is far closer an analog would be a much harder thing to get past legal sinc it wouldn t be base on make regul on public properti but in restrict activ on privat properti us of gun in crime in norwai some crime ar commit with gun that have been in the owner arm for a long time but these ar rather the exept most crimin accuir gun to us them in crime and mostli short time befor the crime us of knive it is allow to cari knife in public but not in your belt or open you american think it s ok to have a gun but not to carri it open in public rigth thi vari wide on thing i think european have a difficult time with is that the u s ha fifti uniqu jurisdict where the law from on state to anoth can be as radic differ as from on countri in europ to anoth some place allow open carri of both gun and knive some allow conceal some prohibit both or allow on or the other and it can be either a state or local restriciton individu vs mass ye the individu is more import than the mass but onli to some extent your crimin law ar to protect the individu who make the mass what happen when the rigth of some individu affect the right of all the other the question must be ask is the right of thi individu affect the right of thi other individu what we usual get is that the right of thi group mean some individu within thi group here defin as peopl who own gun ar advers affect the right of some other group if for instanc bob were us hi gun to attack steve you d have a point but essenti what we re discuss is that becuas some person who qualifi as a member of the group peopl who own gun then some third person perhap in anoth time zone is told that their be a member of that group is take awai somebodi els s right it s like try to punish all newspap for the libel commit by on the issu i believ the issu is gun and gun legisl the issu is crime violenc and murder the question is to what extent gun and gun legisl impact those we shouldn t mix weapon and item that can serv as on if i live in amerika i would probabl have a gun to defend myself in home but should it have to be like that of cours not it would be nice if we didn t have to fear that other peopl might get it into their twist littl mind to hurt us but current we don t have that option nor do i expect we will do you think it s wise to sell gun like candi some state do no state doe in ani case there s a limit to which the state mai enforc it s wisdom on me freedom in gener is an unwis concept if you pre emptiv restrict everyth which might be unwis then freedom becom a meaningless concept if you believ it s smart neccaceri to have driver licenc why do you think it should be free to bui gun i ll rais my hand against driver s licens as current implement thei re a wast of time and littl more than revanu gener for the state and ignor by a startl number of driver it doe not guarante a level of skill ani higher than is necessari to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebodi els kill or a knowledg of traffic law beyond what ani ten year old will have pick up ride around in hi parent car but as i mention thei re two differ thing david veal univ of tenn div of cont educ info servic group pa146008 utkvm1 utk edu i still rememb the wai you laugh the dai your push me down the
