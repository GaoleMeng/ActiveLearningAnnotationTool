begin pgp sign messag pleas note that the follow speech wa made by chuck hammil in 1987 address all letter to hi address given at the end of thi document russel from crossbow to cryptographi thwart the state via technolog given at the futur of freedom confer novemb 1987 you know technolog and particularli comput technolog ha often gotten a bad rap in libertarian cir cle we tend to think of orwel s 1984 or terri gilliam s brazil or the proxim detector keep east berlin s slave citizen on their own side of the border or the so phistic bug devic nixon us to harass those on hi enemi list or we recogn that for the price of a ticket on the concord we can fly at twice the speed of sound but onli if we first walk thru a magnetomet run by a govern policeman and permit him to paw thru our be long if it beep but i think that mind set is a mistak befor there were cattl prod govern tortur their prison with club and rubber hose befor there were laser for eavesdrop govern us binocular and lip reader though govern certainli us technolog to oppress the evil li not in the tool but in the wielder of the tool in fact technolog repres on of the most promi ing avenu avail for re captur our freedom from those who have stolen them by it veri natur it favor the bright who can put it to us over the dull who can not it favor the adapt who ar quick to see the merit of the new over the sluggish who cling to time test wai and what two better word ar there to de scribe govern bureaucraci than dull and sluggish on of the clearest classic triumph of technolog over tyranni i see is the invent of the man portabl crossbow with it an untrain peasant could now reliabl and lethal engag a target out to fifti meter even if that target were a mount chain mail knight unlik the longbow which admittedli wa more power and could get off more shot per unit time the crossbow requir no formal train to util wherea the longbow requir elabor visual tactil and kinesthet coordin to achiev ani degre of accuraci the wielder of a crossbow could simpli put the weapon to hi shoulder sight along the arrow itself and be reason assur of hit hi tar get moreov sinc just about the onli mount knight like to visit your averag peasant would be govern soldier and tax collector the util of the devic wa plain with it the common rabbl could defend themselv not onli against on anoth but against their government master it wa the mediev equival of the armor pierc bullet and consequ king and priest the mediev equival of a bureau of alcohol tobacco and crossbow threaten death and excommun respec tive for it unlaw possess look at later develop we see how technolog like the firearm particularli the repeat rifl and the handgun later follow by the gatl gun and more advanc machin gun radic alter the balanc of interperson and inter group power not without reason wa the colt 45 call the equal a frail danc hall hostess with on in her possess wa now fulli abl to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in ani saloon advertis ment for the period also reflect the merchandis of the repeat cartridg rifl by declar that a man on horseback arm with on of these rifl simpli cannot be captur and as long as hi captor were reli upon flintlock or singl shot rifl the quot is doubtless a true on updat now to the present the public kei cipher with a person comput to run it repres an equiv alent quantum leap in a defens weapon not onli can such a techniqu be us to protect sensit data in on s own possess but it can also permit two stranger to ex chang inform over an insecur commun channel a wiretap phone line for exampl or skywrit for that matter without ever have previous met to exchang cipher kei with a thousand dollar com puter you can creat a cipher that a multi megabuck crai x mp can t crack in a year within a few year it should be econom feasibl to similarli encrypt voic communi cation soon after that full color digit video imag technolog will not onli have made wiretap obsolet it will have total demolish govern s control over in format transfer i d like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat ic which make thi principl possibl thi algorithm is call the rsa algorithm after rivest shamir and adleman who jointli creat it it secur deriv from the fact that if a veri larg number is the product of two veri larg prime then it is extrem difficult to obtain the two prime factor from analysi of their product ex treme in the sens that if prime p and q have 100 digit apiec then their 200 digit product cannot in gen eral be factor in less than 100 year by the most power comput now in exist the public part of the kei consist of 1 the prod uct pq of the two larg prime p and q and 2 on fac tor call it x of the product xy where xy p 1 q 1 1 the privat part of the kei consist of the other factor y each block of the text to be encrypt is first turn into an integ either by us ascii or even a simpl a 01 b 02 c 03 z 26 represent thi integ is then rais to the power x modulo pq and the result integ is then sent as the encrypt messag the receiv decrypt by take thi integ to the secret power y modulo pq it can be shown that thi process will alwai yield the origin number start with what make thi a groundbreak develop and why it is call public kei cryptographi is that i can openli publish the product pq and the number x while keep secret the number y so that anyon can send me an encrypt messag name x a mod pq but onli i can recov the origin messag a by take what thei send rais it to the power y and take the result mod pq the riski step meet to exchang cipher kei ha been elimin so peopl who mai not even trust each other enough to want to meet mai still reliabl ex chang encrypt messag each parti have select and dissemin hi own pq and hi x while maintain the secreci of hi own y anoth benefit of thi scheme is the notion of a dig ital signatur to enabl on to authent the sourc of a given messag normal if i want to send you a messag i rais my plaintext a to your x and take the result mod your pq and send that howev if in my messag i take the plaintext a and rais it to my secret power y take the result mod my pq then rais that result to your x mod your pq and send thi then even after you have normal decrypt the messag it will still look like garbag howev if you then rais it to my public power x and take the result mod my public pq so you will not onli recov the ori ginal plaintext messag but you will know that no on but i could have sent it to you sinc no on els know my secret y and these ar the veri concern by the wai that ar to dai torment the soviet union about the whole question of person comput on the on hand thei recogn that american schoolchildren ar right now grow up with com puter as commonplac as sliderul us to be more so in fact becaus there ar thing comput can do which will interest and instruct 3 and 4 year old and it is pre cise these student who on gener henc will be go head to head against their soviet counterpart for the soviet to hold back might be a suicid as continu to teach swordsmanship while your adversari ar learn ballist on the other hand whatev els a person comput mai be it is also an exquisit effici copi machin a floppi disk will hold upward of 50 000 word of text and can be copi in a coupl of minut if thi weren t threaten enough the comput that perform the copi can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but unbreak rememb that in soviet societi publicli ac cessibl xerox machin ar unknown the rel few copi machin in exist ar control more inten sive than machin gun ar in the unit state now the conserv posit is that we should not sell these comput to the soviet becaus thei could us them in weapon system the liber posit is that we should sell them in the interest of mutual trade and cooper and anywai if we don t make the sale there will certainli be some other nation will to for my part i m readi to suggest that the libertarian posit should be to give them to the soviet for free and if necessari make them take them and if that doesn t work load up an sr 71 blackbird and air drop them over moscow in the middl of the night paid for by privat sub scription of cours not taxat i confess that thi is not a posit that ha gain much support among member of the convent left right polit spectrum but af ter all in the word of on of illuminatu s charact we ar polit non euclidean the shortest distanc to a particular goal mai not look anyth like what most peopl would consid a straight line take a long enough world view it is arguabl that break the soviet govern ment monopoli on inform transfer could better lead to the enfeebl and inde to the ultim dissolut of the soviet empir than would the product of anoth dozen missil aim at moscow but there s the rub a long enough world view doe suggest that the evil the oppress the coerciv and the simpli stupid will get what thei deserv but what s not immedi clear is how the rest of us can escap be kill enslav or pauper in the process when the liber and other collectivist began to at tack freedom thei possess a reason stabl healthi function economi and almost unlimit time to proce to hamstr and dismantl it a polici of polit gradual wa at least conceiv but now we have patchwork crazi quilt economi held togeth by bale wire and spit the state not onli tax us to feed the poor while also induc farmer to slaughter milk cow and drive up food price it then simultan turn around and sub sidiz research into agricultur chemic design to in creas yield of milk from the cow left aliv or wit the fact that a declin in the price of oil is consid as potenti frighten as a compar increas a few year ago when the price went up we were told the economi risk collaps for for want of energi the price increas wa call the moral equival of war and the fed swung into action for the first time in american histori the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morn be came an issu of feder concern now when the price of oil drop again we risk problem thi time becaus ameri can oil compani and third world basket case nation who sell oil mai not be abl to ever pai their debt to our grossli over extend bank the suggest panacea is that govern should now re rais the oil price that opec ha lower via a new oil tax sinc the govern is seek to rais oil price to about the same extent as opec did what can we call thi except the moral equival of civil war the govern against it own peopl and classic in intern trade can you imag in ani entiti in the world except a govern go to court claim that a vendor wa sell it good too cheapli and demand not onli that that naughti vendor be compel by the court to rais it price but also that it be punish for the act of lower them in the first place so while the statist could afford to take a coupl of hundr year to trash our economi and our liberti we certainli cannot count on have an equival period of stabil in which to reclaim them i contend that there exist almost a black hole effect in the evolut of nation state just as in the evolut of star onc free dom contract beyond a certain minimum extent the state warp the fabric of the polit continuum about itself to the degre that subsequ re emerg of freedom becom all but imposs a good illustr of thi can be seen in the area of so call welfar payment when those who sup at the public trough outnumb and thu outvot those whose tax must replenish the trough then what possibl choic ha a democraci but to perpetu and expand the tak ing from the few for the unearn benefit of the mani go down to the nearest welfar offic find just two peopl on the dole and recogn that between them thei form a vote bloc that can forev outvot you on the question of who own your life and the fruit of your life s labor so essenti those who love liberti need an edg of some sort if we re ultim go to prevail we obvi ousli can t us the altruist other directed of work slave suffer sacrific so that next gener of a billion random stranger can live in a better world recogn that howev immor such an appeal might be it is nonetheless an extrem power on in todai s cultur if you can convinc peopl to work energet for a caus care onli enough for their person welfar so as to remain aliv enough and healthi enough to continu work then you have a truli massiv reservoir of energi to draw from equal clearli thi is just the sort of ap peal which tautolog cannot be util for egoist or libertarian goal if i were to stand up befor you tonight and sai someth like listen follow me as i enunci my nobl caus contribut your monei to support the caus give up your free time to work for the caus strive selflessli to bring it about and then after you and your children ar dead mayb your children s children will actu alli live under egoism you d all think i d gone mad and of cours you d be right becaus the point i m try to make is that libertarian and or egoism will be spread if when and as individu libertarian and or egoist find it profit and or enjoy to do so and probabl onli then while i certainli do not disparag the concept of poli tical action i don t believ that it is the onli nor even necessarili the most cost effect path toward increas freedom in our time consid that for a fraction of the invest in time monei and effort i might expend in try ing to convinc the state to abolish wiretap and all form of censorship i can teach everi libertarian who s in terest how to us cryptographi to abolish them unilater there is a maxim a proverb gener attribut to the eskimo which veri like most libertarian have al readi heard and while you like would not quarrel with the sai you might well feel that you ve heard it often enough alreadi and that it ha noth further to teach us and moreov that mayb you re even tire of hear it i shall therefor repeat it now if you give a man a fish the sai run you feed him for a dai but if you teach a man how to fish you feed him for a lifetim your exposur to the quot wa probabl in some sort of a workfar vs welfar context name that if you genuin wish to help someon in need you should teach him how to earn hi susten not simpli how to beg for it and of cours thi is true if onli becaus the next time he is hungri there might not be anybodi around will or even abl to give him a fish wherea with the inform on how to fish he is complet self suffici but i submit that thi exhaust onli the first order content of the quot and if there were noth further to glean from it i would have wast your time by cite it again after all it seem to have almost a crypto altruist slant as though to impli that we should structur our ac tiviti so as to maxim the benefit to such hungri beggar as we mai encount but consid suppos thi eskimo doesn t know how to fish but he doe know how to hunt walrus you on the other hand have often gone hungri while travel thru walru countri becaus you had no idea how to catch the damn thing and thei at most of the fish you could catch and now suppos the two of you decid to exchang inform barter fish knowledg for hunt knowledg well the first thing to observ is that a transact of thi type categor and unambigu refut the marxist premis that everi trade must have a winner and a loser the idea that if on person gain it must necessarili be at the expens of anoth person who lose clearli under thi scenario such is not the case each parti ha gain some thing he did not have befor and neither ha been dimin ish in ani wai when it come to exchang of inform rather than materi object life is no longer a zero sum game thi is an extrem power notion the law of diminish return the first and second law of thermodynam all those law which constrain our possi biliti in other context no longer bind us now that s anarchi or consid anoth possibl suppos thi hungri eskimo never learn to fish becaus the ruler of hi nation state had decre fish illeg becaus fish contain danger tini bone and sometim sharp spine he tell us the state ha decre that their consumpt and even their possess ar too hazard to the peopl s health to be permit even by knowledg will adult perhap it is becaus citizen bodi ar thought to be govern properti and therefor it is the function of the state to punish those who improperli care for govern ment properti or perhap it is becaus the state gener ousli extend to compet adult the benefit it provid to children and to the mental ill name a full time all pervas supervisori conservatorship so that thei need not troubl themselv with make choic about behavior thought physic riski or moral naughti but in ani case you stare stupefi while your eskimo inform re late how thi law is taken so serious that a friend of hi wa recent imprison for year for the crime of po session of nine ounc of trout with intent to distribut now you mai conclud that a societi so grotesqu oppress as to enforc a law of thi type is simpli an affront to the digniti of all human be you mai go far ther and decid to commit some portion of your discret ari recreat time specif to the task of thwart thi tyrant s goal your rational mai be altruist in the sens of want to liber the oppress or egoist in the sens of prove you can outsmart the oppressor or veri like some combin of these or per hap even other motiv but sinc you have zero desir to becom a martyr to your caus you re not about to mount a militari campaign or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockad howev it is here that technolog and in particular in format technolog can multipli your efficaci liter a hundredfold i sai liter becaus for a fraction of the effort and virtual none of the risk attend to smuggl in a hundr fish you can quit readili produc a hundr xerox copi of fish instruct if the tar gete govern like present dai america at least permit open discuss of topic whose implement is re strict then that should suffic but if the govern attempt to suppress the flow of inform as well then you will have to take a littl more effort and perhap write your fish manual on a floppi disk encrypt accord to your mythic eskimo s public kei paramet but as far as increas real world access to fish you have made genuin nonzero headwai which mai continu to snowbal as other re dissemin the inform you have provid and you have not had to wast ani of your time try to convert id eolog adversari or even try to win over the und cide recal harri brown s dictum from freedom in an unfre world that the success of ani endeavor is in gener invers proport to the number of peopl whose persua sion is necessari to it fulfil if you look at histori you cannot deni that it ha been dramat shape by men with name like washington lincoln nixon marco duvali khadaffi and their ilk but it ha also been shape by peopl with name like edison curi marconi tesla and wozniak and thi latter shape ha been at least as per vasiv and not nearli so bloodi and that s where i m try to take the libertech project rather than beseech the state to pleas not en slave plunder or constrain us i propos a libertarian net work spread the technolog by which we mai seiz freedom for ourselv but here we must be a bit care while it is not at present illeg to encrypt inform when govern want to spy on you there is no guarante of what the fu ture mai hold there have been bill introduc for exam ple which would have made it a crime to wear bodi armor when govern want to shoot you that is if you were to commit certain crime while wear a kevlar vest then that fact would constitut a separ feder crime of it own thi law to my knowledg ha not pass yet but it doe indic how govern think other technolog applic howev do inde pose legal risk we recogn for exampl that anyon who help a pre civil war slave escap on the underground railroad wa make a clearli illeg us of technolog as the sovereign govern of the unit state of america at that time found the bui and sell of human be quit as accept as the bui and sell of cattl simi larli dure prohibit anyon who us hi bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illeg psychoact drug alcohol the control substanc wine wa us technol ogi in a wai that could get him shot dead by feder agent for hi crime unfortun not to be restor to life when congress revers itself and re permit us of thi drug so to quot a former presid un indict co conspir and pardon felon let me make on thing perfectli clear the libertech project doe not advoc particip in or conspir in the violat of ani law no matter how oppress unconstitut or simpli stupid such law mai be it doe engag in descript for educa tional and inform purpos onli of technolog process and some of these process like fly a plane or manufactur a firearm mai well requir appropri li cens to perform legal fortun no licens is need for the distribut or receipt of inform it self so the next time you look at the polit scene and despair think well if 51% of the nation and 51% of thi state and 51% of thi citi have to turn libertarian befor i ll be free then somebodi might as well cut my goddamn throat now and put me out of my miseri recogn that such is not the case
