in articl 1993apr15 093231 5148 new yale edu steve tomassi write hi basebal fan so what do you sai don t you think he deserv it i mean heck if dave winfield ho hum is serious be consid for it as is lee smith ha then why don t we give dave kingman a chanc or darrel evan yeah yeah after the hall of fame take in them it can take in eddi murrai and jeff reardon i am try to think how to respond to thi without involv person feel or percept and i can not without have stat to back up my point howev i think you approach thi the wrong wai i believ all of the peopl mention here deserv the hall of fame more than dave kingman doe i feel thei were all much better player i am not sai i fell thei deserv to go but that thei would deserv it more imho dave kingman defin not thei gui onli had a coupl of year were he could hit with atleast a respect averag the rest of hi career i do not think he wa veri fear by pitcher i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean realli i am a met fan he wa a met for part of hi career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he is fear by pitcher he ha had sever season where he hit for a respect averag and hi product number ar in my opinion without stat better than kingman s probabl by quit a bit i also perceiv him to be a leader mayb not as much as some other peopl but none the less a leader i think he ha made substanti contribut to the game of basebal and to societi exampl of thi ar some of the charit thing he ha done i know some of thi from when he wa with the yanke i think he the type of player that kid can look up to and while thi is defin not the onli criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserv some consider lee smith mayb i would have to see hi stat again but he defin would deserv to go befor the like of kingman darrel evan no eddi murrai mayb he ha had a veri good career he is a leader although a silent on he is a good role model ar the stat good enough i am not sure but i would onc again believ thei ar much better than kingman s both the averag as well as the power number but not as good as winfield s just think eddi did not have as much public for most of hi great year jeff reardon my guess is no but it kind of depend on hi number off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well in ani case i am sick and tire mostli sick of everybodi give hall of fame consider to player that ar by todai s standard margin honestli ozzi smith and robin yount don t belong there thei re both shortstop that just hung around for a long time big deal well i strongli disagre here both of these gui deserv it for sure i talk about leadership abov both of these gui ar leader and have been instument in lead their team to the post season robin doe have veri good offens number both averag and power and ozzi ha okai number offens the differ with ozzi is that if you gave him a home run for everi run he save by make an incred plai at shortstop he would have shatter aaron s home run mark by now how mani of those great plai save game how mani of those great plai motiv hi team to ralli and win a game while i believ both of these gui have number basebal is about more than number or at least win at basebal is about more than number both of these gui ar proven star and belong in the hall of fame as doe georg brett who also belong in thi class of player let s be a littl more select huh stop hand out these honor so liber save them for the gui who realli deserv it face it if someth isn t done there will be littl prestig in the hall of fame anymor when certain individu believ that steve garvei or jack morri ar potenti candid the absurd is appar gee can these gui even compar to the more like futur hall of famer like kirbi puckett or nolan ryan steve garvei i am not sure probabl not but i guess i could see someon make a case for him jack morri onc again not my first choic but i can see why someon might bring up hi name kirbi puckett probabl the onli reason i do not sai defin is he still ha time left in hi career if he continu do what he ha been then my probabl will turn into a defin nolan ryan is there realli ani doubt i think i heard someth about him have some 53 record mayb thei were not all good i don t know i did not hear ani of them just the number he ha the number he ha the contribut to the game and commun and he is a great role model i would not sai that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probabl not even top 20 but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame becaus of hi accomplish no hitter strikeout respect number even with some weaker team you can go on and on i realli hope he get all the possibl vote so in sum up i have 3 group those that belong those that probabl do but i am not sure and those that i lean toward sai don t belong at least not without my see stat and possibl hear reason why thei should go ye winfield yount brett not in your mail o smith puckett and ryan mayb murrai and l smith no reardon garvei morri evan and defin kingman as i said i do not have the stat around so i do not have number to back thi up these ar entir my opinion base on my percept mike q steve
