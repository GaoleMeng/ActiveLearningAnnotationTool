wlsmith valv heart rri uwo ca wayn smith write thi doesn t answer the origin question is os 2 a multi user os and no mention wa made of an ether card either but from a disk data point of view why doe scsi have an advantag when it come to multi task data is data and it could be anywher on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the comput faster doe it have a better cach system i thought scsi wa good at manag a data bu when multipl devic ar attach if we ar onli talk about a singl drive explain why scsi is inher faster at manag data from a hard drive you ar make the same mistak i did you ar confus the drive interfac to the data throughput interfac again from my mac ibm info sheet avail by ftp on sumex aim stanford edu 36 44 0 6 in the info mac report as mac ibm compar173 txt expans both mac ibm scsi onli extern devic expans interfac common to both mac and ibm allow the us of ani devic hard drive printer scanner nubu card expans mac plu onli some monitor and cd rom appl develop some specif for scsi control while ibm ha no exact control specif which result in ad incompat on ibm machin main problem there ar a lot of extern devic which ar intern termin which caus problem for more then two devis off the scsi port a scsi chain is suppos to be termin onli at the begin and at the end ani other set up caus problem for either mac or ibm scsi 1 7 devic per scsi control 8 bit asynchron 1 5mb s av and synchron 5mb s max transfer base 16 bit scsi 1 requir a scsi 2 control chip and can provid onli fast scsi 2 not wide scsi 2 which ar both 16 bit interfac see scsi 2 scsi 2 10 devic per scsi control in scsi 2 mode scsi 2 is fulli scsi 1 complient and tend to be impliment as a veri fast scsi 1 sinc it need a differ control interfac in both hardwar which tend to be veri expends and softwar transfer speed ar 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst 32 bit wide and fast scsi 2 in scsi 1 mode is limit to 7 devic and reduc 8 bit or 16 bit fast onli throughput due to the differ between scsi 1 and wide scsi 2 port ibm hd interfac limit to hard drive by design or lack of develop id integr devic electron current the most common standard and is mainli us for medium size drive can have more than on hard drive asynchron transfer 5mb s max so at it lowest set scsi 2 interfac in asynchron scsi 1 mode averag the through put maximum of id in asynchron mode in full scsi 2 mode it blow poor id out the window down the street and into the garbag can the problem becom can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rate and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi 2 come from not the interfac itself but more and more from drive mechanisim to us the scsi 2 through put the cost of scsi interfac is a self fullil prophisi few peopl bui scsi becaus it is so expenc for the pc which in turn convic make that mass produc scsi which would reduc it cost is unwar and so scsi is expenc that is the effect of the rule of scale the more item sold the less each item ha to bare the brunt the cost of manufactur and so the less each item ha to cost scsi 2 allow a drive mechanisim through put to be limit by the drive while id itself limit the through put
