dave davi write let my state my point as provoc as possibl after go through sever studi bibl i m lean heavili toward the assert that _sirach_ the wisdom of ben sira or ecclesiasticu is directli referenc by _jame_ in fact i think sirach is more directli referenc by jame than _job_ or _ruth_ is referenc in ani nt vers i ve seen good point the new testament doe not quot ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiast or song of song just as it doe not quot from the deuterocanon but if the non quotat of the former doe not disqualifi them neither doe the non quotat of the later and the wisodm of solomon wa quit clearli an influenc on st paul especi in the letter to the roman cf especi roman 1 18 32 and wisdom 13 14 stuff delet i think everyon would agre that principl that cannot be consist appli ar not veri us as principl so if we ar to exclud them not accord them the author of scriptur we would appear to requir other reason what might these reason be tradit alwai a fav with episcop tradit is equivoc on thi subject sirach i believ is in vaticanu sinaiticu i don t know if it is list in the muratorian canon the oldest list i know of sirach and the other ar discuss by the father as scriptur but not unanim true not all accept them as scriptur though niether were all the book of the new testament so accept which put to the lie the whole argument of the book be exclud becaus thei were debat and not univers accept hebrew the apocalyps 2 peter esther and other were debat at variou time but eventu retain as for the codex you mention both vaticanu and sinaitcu includ the deuterocanon both of the new and old testament and vaticanu i think inlcud 1 clement the shepard of herma and the epistl of baranaba as for the muratorian canon it deal with the new testament onli though it is veri valuabl in it wit to those book my interim conclus is that protest exclus of at least on of these write is on of those tradit of men on hear of so often thei were exclud dure the reform and that appear to be the reason mani peopl continu to exclud them ani taker i can be reason if all els fail show me where i m wrong you re not wrong it is a tradit of men to exlcud them as i

list wa promulg again at the third council of carthag 397 ad and at the sixth council of carthag 419 ad at which council the same list wa enumer with the word becaus we have reciev from the father that these ar the book to be read in the church which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holi scriptur we do understand those book of whose author there wa never ani doubt in the church as the episcop church doe in remov the deuterocanon from the realm of scriptur though the episcopalian hold them in high regard and read them in the church thei ar not count as scriptur by them and mai not be us to prove dogma the lutheran hold out similarli earlier mention of the so call apocrypha as divin scriptur can also be found and below i inlcud onli a portion of the quot call it divin scriptur that could be found among the write of the father and thi is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckon as consist of twenti two book so that thei mai correspond to the number of letter in the hebrew alphabet it is to be note also that by ad to these tobia and judith there ar twenti four book correspond to the number of letter us by the greek st hillari of poitier commentari on the psalm prologu 15 365 ad the twenti two book accord to the hebrew ar jeremiah with lament and the letter reckon as on and also there is maccabe origen commentari on the psalm psalm 1 245 ad

person for if disput involv the new testament deutero canon doe not disqulaifi those book i e hebrew jame 2 peter 2 3 john jude revel in protest ey than neither should it disqulaifi the old testament book and i must point out that the jew onli drew up their canon in 90 ad 60 year after the found of the christian religion upon the cross why should we adher to a canon that wa drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the chrsitian us of the greek septuagint which includ the deutero canon as earli as 150 ad st justin had alreadi accus the jew of mutil the canon of scriptur by their remov of
