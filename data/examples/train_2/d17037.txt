in articl 1993mai10 210603 17797 colorado edu perlman qso colorado edu eric s perlman write fine now if your opinion isn t convinc anyon and it s get refut regularli by the fact which is the case isn t it like that your opinion need some revis as i said i do not want to convic anyon so why should my opinion convinc anyon i do not believ that my opinion ar refut by fact then you haven t been pai attent to the argument level against them thei have been over and over again thei will be again so far you have present your opinion as oppos to mine i would hardli take them as fact mayb youi view of a dictionari is the problem here on thing is the accept mean of a word by a dictionari and sometim a complet differ thing is what that word came to mean after a long time hei what do you think dictionari ar for you quit obvious need on a good dictionari give both and you well know it i could give you hundr of word in my mother tongu spanish that ar comonli us and you will never find in a dictionari even more i could show you a lot of mean that word in spanish have differ from those in the dictionari ok tell me how mani peopl in zionist movement defin a jew in a differ wai and how mani ar who defin jew base on a religi wai i don t think that data exist on thi directli and guess why isn t it curiou that we do not know how mani peopl defin in how mani differ wai the term jew which is the basi of the movement itself so the evid show that up to now jew when consid in term of israel the law of return and jewish nation is defin in term of religion and not of cultur ident even if 80% of those defin as jew in isreal ar not religi in the same wai i believ that irish have a right to nation but i do not support the bomb and kill of the ira i believ that jew have a right to nation but i do not support zionism as it is right now compar the action of israel to that of the ira is like compar those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for exampl with the ira in the role of pinochet you realli need to get your histori straight you also need a basic dictionari you need to start read befor answer my point wa that becaus some movement claim to be nationalist it doe not mean that i consid it to be nationalist i did not comapr israel to the ira i think that you ar start to put word on my mouth and that is wrong that is no problem but onc again you ar defin zionism as on movement you ar impli that it is monolith you know thi is not and ha never been the case that is a problem i am sai that i do not support zionism as it is now i believ that among the peopl in the soviet communist parti some might even had been inspir by nobl ideal doe that chang the final result of what happen in the ussr in the same wai even if the zionist movement is not homogen it doe not matter what matter is the result i never said that zionism is monolith if you ar go to attribut me thing present the quot where i said that you don t sai it directli you impli it and i show explicitli where and how you impli it now you re try to wriggl out of it won t wash and you know it i never said it directli nor indirectli i am not talk about individu who defin themselv as zionist here i am sure most of them ar good honest and care peopl i am talk about the result of the zionist movement i am talk about a movement whose action result in a law of return with a religi definit of jew a countri that defin nation base on religion i am talk about someth i consid a form of racism such as differenci base on religi belief after all if arab in israel cannot serv in the armi is becasu thei were not born in the right religion what you said is that judaism is defin accord to religi standard now thi can have sever differ mean and you know it on of the mean that it can have is to sai that onli those who ar religi ar defin as jew anoth is to sai that onli those who meet the religi definit of a jew is on and there ar other i m not twist your word i m try to make you awar that your word don t mean what you think thei do i had never heard the definit onli those who ar religi ar defin as jew i had alwai seen the definit a person is a jew is hi her mother is wa a jew and if such person doe not convert although i had seen peopl argu about the last part i am not talk about the debat i am talk about how thing ar right now when the debat is over i ll see what happen right now thing ar like thei ar let me ask you on thing i understand that israel differenci between citizenship and nation suppos m al and f emal have a child in israel which nation will the child s id show accord to each on of the follow case actual it doesn t and the citizen right ar exactli the same in both case anywai so there is no differ between citizenship and nation in israel or what do you mean by actual it doesn t a f and m ar both jewish jewish b f is jewsh and m is not jewish c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish it ll depend on what religion is practic in the hous the origin law of return would still admit such a person if thei were jewish if memori serv so it follow a religi definit and not a cultur on that is what i call a form of racism i do not know why you ar so touchi i never said that you did not support palestinian self determin i just gave an exampl of hypocrisi no you didn t you had to twist the definit of the word 180 degre in order to do so and everyon els know it i m not be touchi you do not need to assum the represent of everybodi els to make your point you should assum that you ar just talk for yourself about the other stuff i still believ that the exampl wa a valid on it would be a hypocrisi to sai that on support nation for all and then support zionism and then disregard the palestinian s right i never said that someon in thi net is guilti of it it wa just an exampl noth more noth less than that why did you have to clarifi what you think becaus what you gave wa not an exampl it wa an exampl of how the definit of a word can be twist around 180 degre it wa an exampl you ar try to justifi someth nobodi ha talk about first you should know that word have more mean than those given in the dictionari oh so now what ar dictionari for refer it s not nonsens when peopl read what you write thei have to try to associ a mean to those word dictionari give the mean of word don t thei ye but not all of them a languag is someth that evolv all the time it seem that you cannot answer to the idea given by other without insult other sad not at all what i cannot abid is utter bombast when you ve been proven complet wrong not realli i post in anoth post the definit of zionism and in thi post you have show for me what i wa tell you from the begin zionism is a form of racism even if most zionist ar not racist in their individu and privat life a movement that ask for a state and nation right for a peopl and then in practic that peopl ar defin accord to religion is for me racist like i never put even on syllabl in your mouth you have tri to prove thi and you fail you did it next time be more care ha there s noth resembl fact in what you ve said i never ad anyth to what you said do you know the differ between opinion and fact eric s perlman
