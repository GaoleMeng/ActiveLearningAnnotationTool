just a few comment about the feasabl of zip up a bunch of mile on your electron odomet with an oscil i wouldn t expect to be abl to do thi not becaus the engin at bmw ar put in anti fraud logic but just becaus an automobil is a noisi hostil environ for electron and i would expect the softwar to be conserv if i were to design a microprocessor base odomet speedomet program it would have the follow featur just off the top of my head debounc deglitch is thi a real puls or just a glitch smooth the rate of chang of speed cannot be too high thi is a car not an electron top speed limit anyth abov 200mph is ridicul must be electr nois or contact bounc as for get in and preset the pin if thi is the circuit board out of a bmw dashboard i seem to rememb a singl big chip with lotsa pin in the middl of the card good luck get at the counter i wouldn t expect a high input frequenc to damag the meter rememb it s probabl damp so it can t move too fast and is probabl protect after all a car is an extrem hostil place for delic electron there us to be an app note in the nation semiconductor linear databook that went into thi in good detail jerri kaidor tr2 jerri dragoman com jkaidor synopt com jerri kaidor
