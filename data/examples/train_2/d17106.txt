i will try to answer some of dorin s question even though thei were not address to me specif but i feel that i am a bit concern by the thread sinc i am a southern lebanes from a villag that is often on the receiv end of israel s bomb in the first place the death of three soldier on a patrol in occupi lebanes terrritori is not an act of terror or murder it is disingen to compar their death to that of athlet in munich or ani other act of terror or mrder thi exercis is aim sole at divert the issu and is far from the truth it seem to me dorin that you ar so remot and ignor of the problem on the ground that your comment can onli be charactr as irrelev and heavili color by the preconcept and misinform i will try to paint the most accur pictur i can of what the situat realli is in south lebanon in articl 1993apr15 152455 14555 unoc com stssdxb st unoc com dorin baru write is there ani isra a civilian in your opinion now i do not condon myself bomb villag ani kind of villag but you claim these ar villag with civilian and ira claim thei ar camp fill with terrorist you claim that isra shell the villag with the hope of find a terrorist or so if thei kill on fine if not too bad civilian die right i am not so sure i am i wa back in my home villag thi last summer for your inform we ar peopl not a bunch of indiscrimin terrorist most of the peopl in my villag ar regular inhabit that go about their daili busi some work in the field some own small shop other ar older men that go to the coff shop and drink coffe is that so hard to imagin it is not a terrorist camp as you and the isra like to view the villag thei ar small commun with kid plai soccer in the street women prepar lunch men plai card etc some young men usual ag between 17 to 30 year ar member of the lebanes resist even the inhabit of the villag do not know who these ar thei ar secret about it but most peopl often suspect who thei ar and what thei ar up to these young men ar support financi by iran most of the time thei sneak arm and ammunit into the occupi zone where thei set up boobi trap for isra patrol everi time an isra soldier is kill or injur by these trap israel retalli by indiscrimin bomb villag of their own choos often kill onli innoc civilian onc thei ar back thei announc that thei bomb a terrorist hideout where an 8 year old girl just happen to be we ar now accustom to isra tactic and we figur that thi is the isra wai of tell us that if you re gonna hurt our soldier you re gonna pai the price we accept thi as a price we have to pai to free our land israel know veri well that it is not realli hurt the resist that much militarili with these strike but rather just keep the pressur on the villag to demand from their young men to stop attack isra soldier sinc these attack ar take a heavi toll on the live of the civilian villag israel s retalli polici is cold heart but a realiti that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanes resist on the other hand is not go to stop it attack on occupi isra soldier until thei withdraw thi is the onli real leverag that thei have to forc israel to withdraw the peopl of south lebanon ar occupi or shell by israel on a regular basi we do not want to be occupi if israel insist that the so call secur zone is necessari for the protect of northern israel than it will have to pai the price of it occup with the blood of it soldier if israel is interest in peac than it should withdraw from our land we ar not ask for the establish of a lebanes occupi zone in northern israel to protect our villag that ar attack on a regular basi by israel so the best polici seem to be the remov of isra occup and the establish of peac keep troop along the border i have written befor on thi veri newsgroup that the onli real solut will come as a result of a comprehens peac settlement wherebi israel withdraw to it own border and peac keep troop ar station along the border to insur no on on either side of the border is shell thi is the onli realist solut it is time for israel to realiz that the concept of a buffer zone aim at protect it northern citi ha fail in fact it ha caus much more isra death than the occasion shell of northern israel would have result in if israel realli want to save some isra live it would withdraw unilater from the so call secur zone befor the conclus of the peac talk such a move would save isra live advanc peac effort give israel a great moral lift better israel s public imag abroad and give it an edg in the peac negoci sinc israel can rightli claim that it is genuin interest in peac and ha alreadi offer some import concess along with such a withdraw israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanes govern and warn that it will not accept ani attack against it northern citi and that if such a shell occur than it will consid re take the buffer zone and will hold the lebanes and syrian govern respons for it there seem to be veri littl incent for the syrian and lebanes goovern to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumst and now the lebanes govern ha proven that it is capabl of control and disarm all militia as thei did in all other part of lebanon if you ask me those question i will have no problem answer not with a question as you did no nobodi is qualifi candid for murder noth justifi murder i agre onli in the case of the isar soldier their kill cannot be qualifi as murder no matter what you sai i have the feel that you mai be abl yourself to make similar statement mayb after elimin all isra jew am i wrong ye we have no quarrel with jew or isra civilian the real problem is with occupi isra soldier and those brave isra pilot that bomb our civilian villag everi time an occupi soldier is attack dorin basil
