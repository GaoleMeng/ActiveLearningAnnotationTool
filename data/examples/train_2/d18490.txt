brian kendig first state i am my own master i ask ar you truli the master of yourself brian kendig state not yet make up your mind but my life is the ground i us to practic on the fun is in the get there we don t start out perfect and we do not end perfect either we ar never perfect can you name on person young or old past or present that you deem perfect good luck i know my shortcom and i know my strength and i live my life accord to the decis i make and i am content to abid with the consequ of my decis as easili as i ll accept the prais for them there have been time in my life when i ve made mistak ye i try to never make the same mistak twice then you lie to yourself you do not know your shortcom i have clearli shown on of your shortcom if not two that is ignor of the bibl and the arrog you demonstr butcher it without even know it content i regard christ as a myth becaus you have been too pride to examin the record of him for yourself and to demonst your lack of support for your conclus i bet you do not even know what the word christ mean or which prophet us christ to describ the son of man i feel that there ar far too mani peopl offer far too mani interpret of what he supposedli said and did the onli person who can realli judg me is me ye i agre with that so we must learn first read the bibl come up with our own interpret evalu what is be said and by whom check the histori book as well compar someon els s interpret with your own then make a judgment but i tell you the truth 99% of what is be said in the bibl need interpret as much as a coffe cup need interpret and rememb the bibl isn t a guru s esoter guid to metaphys it doesn t take a theologian to understand what is be said the bibl is a bunch of testimoni from peopl like you and i address to peopl like you and i these gui wrote down what thei saw and heard is it their open diari and thei want to tell you someth and becaus thei want you to know someth thei make it veri clear what thei want you to know thei didn t encouch their idea in esoter rhetor but in simpl straight forward languag i choos the road i travel and i decid whether or not i want to reach the end of ani given road or turn back and as long as i don t alwai turn back there s no shame in it when i need help i seek out my friend you have chosen the road that avoid the bibl you have chosen the road that avoid a confront with the live god becaus that road doesn t look appeal to you you rather build your own road on that goe far awai from that confront but be assur of thi you will have to confront him on dai willingli or unwillingli and you don t have a clue about what i m sai either open your ey and see open your ear and listen i m not just spout off empti word thi is my life thi is what give me mean i see what you mean i hear what your sai i am not degrad your life but i have heard the same irrat excus for year there is noth new in what you ar sai and by your own word you ar spout off contradict if contradict give you mean then your life must be sad i sai my mother love me how do i know you ask i can point to definit thing she s done for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face to face you sai your deiti love you how do you know i ask bingo for god so love the world he gave hi onli begotton to son so that whososev beliv in him will have ever last life i look what god did he ha given hi son even to hi death so that i can have hope in hi resurrect and know that life isn t for noth but ha gloriou purpos you can t even convinc me that it exist becaus you turn your ey awai from testimoni and histori you choos to lie to yourself that he doesn t exist for you ignor what ha been said for thousand of year you sound exactli almost verbatim like the lazaru of jesu s stori start in luke 16 19 and the conclus of that stori is a bleak on lazaru wound up in hell the stori end like thi for if lazaru doesn t even listen to mose and the prophet he won t even believ if a man rose from the dead if ani god dangl heaven befor me like a carrot promis untold pleasur to me if i ll onli suspend my disbelief and ignor my ration for just thi onc then i would choos hell i can not lie to myself to placat anoth be no matter how power it is arrog at it best the fact is you ar not ration sever specif case have alreadi been cite and again with thi new statement you show more irration with regard to heaven jesu doe tell you someth of what to expect in heaven jesu expect you to us your brain to believ in him jesu doe not expect you to placat either jesu want you to willingli come to him but not as hi grovel slave but rather as hi brother who will share in hi gloriou rich why do you not pick up the bibl and read it for yourself you maintain you have an open mind see whether you ar ly to yourself for yourself why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that s it don t contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it doesn t do you ani good in the end your life doesn t do anybodi els ani good either becaus everyon di anywai so you have no reason to lead a good life lead a good life is meaningless why do you do such a meaningless thing that paragraph demonstr that you haven t listen to a singl word i ve said i do understand what you said but that s is not what i feel went amiss here you miss the point live a good life ha no etern consequ onc thei close the amus park of life to you that is the end to you it is over to you therefor your time spent in the amus park is meaningless it ha no etern consequ to you nor to anyon left on earth but then you contradict yourself from a previou post you said do evil thing is bad to you it shouldn t matter if you do evil thing or good thing it is all meaningless in the end anywai so go rob a bank go tell someon you dislik that he is a dirti rotten slime bag what s restrain you life after all ha no etern consequ and account is irrelev in the same wai i think life is fun and i don t intend to leav the amus park of life until thei close down for the night d at which time you ar truli not the master of yourself i m sorri i don t feel that sacrif jesu wa someth ani god i d worship would do unless the sacrific wa onli temporari in which case it s not realli all that import ha the resurrect sunk in jesu is aliv jesu is not dead so you and your holi book sai by the same token therefor santa clau deliv toi everi xma don t you see i have no reason to believ that what you sai is true pleas give me some reason that i can t similarli appli to santa clau you have everi reason to believ that what jesu sai and the wit of jesu sai ar true but you choos to be unreason and ignor the reason by definit ignor santa clau is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elv and fly reindeer ever see a fly reindeer ha anyon in human histori seen a fly reindeer ha anyon seen a reindeer whose nose blink red on the other hand ar peopl born in bethlehem wa nebuchandezzar realli a king wa daniel realli on of hi court offici were david and solomon realli king of israel and judah wa their realli a king call jehoachin did sennecherib realli attack jerusalem 600 year befor christ did sennacherib realli lose hi battl and badli wa there realli a caiapha who interrog jesu ye ye ye histori verifi it it is nonfict do you have a problem discern truth from fiction perhap you can t evalu the context of grimm s fairi tale apart from that of the scientif american i suppos you treat both with equal truth or equal falsiti is thi what you ar tell me or is it that just do want to read the scientif american and find out that it s not a fairi tale ar you therebi infer that your deiti is noth more than a collect of vers in a book and cannot be support without invok them get real have you ever been to zair do you have to go there to be assur that there realli is such a place given your irration i take it you have never us a map in your life why do you believ what you believ given the overwhelm evid as well as my person experi with the live god i d be an irrat unreason ignor fool if i didn t follow jesu
