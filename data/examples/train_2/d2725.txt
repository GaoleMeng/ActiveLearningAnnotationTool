in articl 1quonm$24c network ucsd edu king cogsci ucsd edu jonathan king write there s too mani s here for my tast by now which mean i ve reach my maximum depth on thi thread i ve cut out some thing below but noth that should affect the sens of the discuss i agre i ll delet more as well fester island com mike fester write king cogsci ucsd edu jonathan king write perhap you can give a more recent citat of ani player mention as a malinger thank i guess i don t understand your question i wa try to impli that the accus of glenn davi maling were certainli not plai up veri much still if the whisper reach san francisco it is certainli possibl thei were stronger elsewher also it wa teammat make the aspers in ani event i know of no other player to be malign in the last coupl year but in ani case i believ mike lavallier ha been accus of poor work habit and gener sloth recent probabl not maling just as he wa be releas it s interest that nobodi heard much about these problem befor if thei were so import i have heard sander call mani thing as well i have not heard him call lazi given the 2 sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as such exactli so which mean hi media detractor have had to sai other thing about him i believ it s a gener phenomenon that if writer don t like you thei ll find a label that will stick no matter who you ar i find myself more interest in the select of label than in why writer feel thei need to act thi wai not that thi fascin me that much either uh the origin author s point wa that black and white player were por trai differ by the media and toward thi he gave a highli select list to prove hi case sander name show up eventu i disput that sander ha ever been call lazi by the media hmm big ego possibl club hous disturb etc is that good press no but it isn t the total extent of the press he receiv in pittsburgh where he wa call all kind of thing includ lazi and spoil by the local columnist again the actual word us mai shift around with time and expedi but lazi tend to be higher on the list for non white player at least in my subject opinion asid it might be interest for somebodi to do an archiv studi on player descript befor and after the color barrier wa broken and on team like the red sox which have been tradition white nowadai most peopl think of carl yastrzemski as on of those blue collar hard work gui but in the earli 70s he wa often portrai as a lazi bum realli hmm i never heard anyon accus canseco of be lazi nor sierra i ve heard accus that canseco wa a bad fielder but could be a great on if he put hi mind to it ignor whether or not he is a actual dave stewart is wa on of the most vocal about thi in ani event that is not lazi at least on poster in the last week ha fire off a major screed on the canseco is lazi issu so i think your point is at best a quibbl and probabl weaker than that uh that poster specif state allow me to be the first it is not a quibbl then to state that the media did not portrai canseco as be lazi if the other person choos to so accus him after my post that doe not make it a quibbl and in fact the media around here tend ed to plai up hi time in the wieght room hardli lazi and hardli a quibbl have you ever seen ani mediot portrai canseco as lazi unconcern with hi field ye lazi no bad fielder i think thi is still interest for that matter i think canseco s color off field antic get lot more nation attent than those of sai roger clemen well he s had a few more of them at least more that you ve heard about i think on of the question here surround select report have said that i have to sai that the select report hypothesi ha the potenti to be unfalsifi at least by those of us who aren t report polic or privat investig well canseco ha been involv in sever feloni includ hi high speed record carri conceal fire arm and of cours the domest violenc clemen had a run in at a bar canseco had that as well and in both case the coverag wa rel minim puckett stewart jackson i said over repres non white three anecdot data point don t make an interest counter argument btw which jackson ar we talk about here reggi bo darrin danni or uh if the onli evid offer is anecdot how can it be object that the counter to it is also anecdot and it seem like everybodi who ha ever won a bat titl among other ha been accus at some time of care more for hi own stat than for the good of the team it also seem to me that you re kirbi puckett i have never heard thi accus made of puckett i have heard it of bogg actual i believ it of him but that s anoth matter not live in minnesota i can t sai whether or not thi line ha ever been us against kirbi there as far as bogg goe i m not sure why you bring him up sinc he s on of the obviou prototyp for the line i quot along with ted william rod carew and mani other uh ye and i agre with your asses of bogg rather specif howev you did sai everybodi who ha ever won a bat titl ha been accus of selfish i have not ever anywher heard thi said of puckett pendleton either similarli brett b william and other how about daryl strawberri and i think the plu or minu refer more to the born again type ie butler and gaetti again you seem to be make an argument from anecdot on the other hand my argument by is of the becaus jon sai so varieti if we have no other data i have to admit i have problem gener list of non white player who becam in famou for their religi or polit belief while name like butler gaetti dravecki knepper hersheis et al come roll out there ar other perhap thei ar simpli not as outspoken except in the case of the born again type i mention mike
