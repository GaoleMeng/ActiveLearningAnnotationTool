support of a major of the unit state senat but it s been held up by a filibust of a minor in the senat just 43 senat thei block a vote that thei know would result in the passag of our bill and the creation of job the issu isn t polit the issu is peopl million of american ar wait for thi legisl and count on it count on us in washington but the job bill ha been ground by gridlock i know the american peopl ar tire of busi as usual and polit as usual i know thei don t want us to spin or wheel thei want the recoveri to get move so i have taken a first step to break thi gridlock and gone the extra mile yesterdai i offer to cut the size of thi plan by 25 percent from $16 billion to $12 billion it s not what i d hope for with 16 million american look for full time work i simpli can t let the bill languish when i know that even a compromis bill will mean hundr of thousand of job for our peopl the mandat is to act to achiev chang and move the countri forward by take thi initi in the face of an unrel senat talkathon i think we can respond to your mandat and achiev a signific portion of our origin goal first we want to keep the program as much as possibl that ar need to gener job and meet human need includ highwai and road construct summer job for young peopl immun for children construct of wast water site and aid to small busi we also want to keep fund for extend unemploy compens benefit for peopl who have been unemploi for a long time becaus the economi isn t creat job second i ve recommend that all the other program in the bill be cut across the board by a littl more than 40 percent and third i ve recommend a new element in thi program to help us immedi start our attempt to fight against crime by provid $200 million for citi and town to rehir polic offic who lost their job dure the recess and put them back to work protect our peopl i m also go to fight for a tough crime bill becaus the peopl of thi countri need it and deserv it now the peopl who ar filibust thi bill the republican senat sai thei won t vote for it becaus it increas deficit spend becaus there s extra spend thi year that hasn t alreadi been approv that sound reason doesn t it here s what thei don t sai thi program is more than paid for by budget cut over my five year budget and thi budget is well within the spend limit alreadi approv by the congress thi year it s amaz to me that mani of these same senat who ar filibust the bill vote dure the previou administr for billion of dollar of the same kind of emerg spend and much of it wa not design to put the american peopl to work thi is not about deficit spend we have offer a plan to cut the deficit thi is about where your prioriti ar on peopl or on polit keep in mind that our job bill is paid for dollar for dollar it is paid for by budget cut and it s the soundest invest we can now make for ourselv and our children i urg all american to take anoth look at thi job and invest program to consid again the benefit for all of us when we ve help make more american partner work to ensur the futur of our nation and the strength of our economi you know if everi american who want a job had on we wouldn t have a lot of the other problem we have in thi countri todai thi bill is not a miracl it s a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explos in thi countri again but it s a step we ought to take and it is fulli paid for over the life of our budget tell your lawmak what you think tell them how import the bill is if it pass we ll all be winner good morn and thank you for listen end 10 11 a m edt
