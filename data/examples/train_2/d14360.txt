background the orion spacedr wa a theoret concept it would be a drive us thermonuclear explos to drive a spacecraft the idea wa that you d deton devic with somewher from on to ten megaton yield behind a pusher plate attach to the main spacecraft the shock wave from the explos would transfer momentum to the ship now in an atmospher i can see thi the energi of the explos heat the atmospher which expand explos and slam a shock wave into the pusher plate but in a vacuum onli two thing i can see ar go to hit the plate fission fusion product barium krypton helium neutron evapor bomb case and electromagnet radiat gamma mostli some light heat from irradi fission product would thi work i can t see the em radiat impel veri much momentum especi given the mass of the pusher plate and it seem to me you re go to get more momentum transfer throw the bomb out the back of the ship than you get from deton them onc thei re there i must be miss someth would someon enlighten me via email thank jim jim goltz alternet engin goltz uunet uu net
