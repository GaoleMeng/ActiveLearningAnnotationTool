in articl apr 21 03 26 39 1993 1370 geneva rutger edu lfoard hopper virginia edu lawrenc c foard write and mani other mail me here is a repli to on of the letter seem to me that atheist do not like the doctrin of hell there s noth like a preacher to put fear into an ignor man if god hadn t creat hell in the first place there d be no no need to die and save us isn t it also a bit paradox to sai god di when in fact no such thing is remot possibl can the infinit die your us 20th centuri concept to interpret 1st centuri writer of cours in your termonolog god could not ceas to exist howev that is not what death ever mean in the scriptur if you will studi the word you will see that it signifi separ death is separ not ceastat thi is the reason for the agoni of the cross for the first time in etern on member of the godhead wa separ from the other two i onc met a young ladi that wa as beauti as ani model that ever live she wa as person as ani saint ever imagin she wa to becom my girlfriend for sever year howev have been draft we were separ by distanc to me that wa a form of death later she decid that she couldn t wait for me to come home and bid me adu that to me wa death it wa separ from that which had made me whole death is separ and etern death is etern separ from hi fellowship not becaus he chose to send you into outer dark but becaus you chose to go there did you know that jesu talk more about hell than he did about heaven thank you for thi info what respect i had for the man now ha been diminish tenfold i promis never again to sai how wise or love thi man wa when i rebel against my earthli father he spank me i found no wisdom in that until i had grown older and especi until i had my own children he wa try to guid me awai from hurt that would enter my life if i continu on my suicid cours he did it in love though i interpret it as harsh and unlov if god warn of impend danger that is love if choos to let us do as we pleas and then at the end tell us the rule that would be harsh you have a conscienc no matter how calus or fallen it is that wit to you that a thing is wrong and that there is caus for fear be jesu wa allegedli god i doubt he could honestli feel the pinprick man dealt him thi mai give light to the error of your understand on must have correct knowledg in order to have correct faith faith and knowledg ar insepar jesu most certainli felt the pinprick of life as the scriptur sai heb 4 15 for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympath with our weak but on who ha been tempt in all thing as we ar yet without sin the kenosi passag of phil 2 state that he gave up hi godhead attribut when he took upon himself human it ha been a favorit medit of mine to think about thi it wa to be my phd thesi the conscious of christ i have talk at length with a great mani peopl about thi interest studi includ clh it is my concluss that as jesu the 2nd member of the triniti actual suffer as we do he becam part of the human race and experienc it as we do he grew in knowledg he chose not to grasp hi omnisci but chose to be taught it is my understand that he wa led of the spirit to such an extent that sometim it is hard to distinquish between jesu the man and jesu as god but in jn 8 where the adulter women wa thrown befor him the tens ar quit clear in that the whole situat took him by surpris that is he wa not awar that thi event wa to take place in time he wa live sequenti histori as you or i mayb some other time we can discuss thi but it is a veri lengthi discuss and on that caus the curcuit breaker of the brain to pop more often than not thank again for the info just so you know some friend and i ar start a freethink organ and i m go to us some of the info you provid for an organ intro duction i wa onc a member of that club the free thinker is a gloriou ideal by contrast of cours you believ that the believ is the unforun repositori of everyth that is dogmat inhibit reactionari and repress i find such a stanc to be as amus as it is absurd if the liber humanist wish to critic a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that is hi right but what he must not pretend is that he wa led to thi sole by hi ration doubt when in fact he wa led to it by hi faith he must acknowledg that while it is ration doubt for him as a free thinker to critic the christian it might equal be a ration doubt for the christian to critic him as a humanist if there is no faith there can be no dout there is no faith which cannot choos to cast doubt on some other faith pascal point out that sceptic argument allow the posit to be posit few speak dubious of sceptic the fact that skeptic ar not skeptic about skeptic is further evid that to doubt anyth we must believ in someth els the person who is skeptic toward on faith or even most faith will be the devot adher of anoth in fact it is a measur of hi poverti both that he is unawar of it and that he can defin himself onli in neg term henc the term a theist some peopl claim otherwis and argu vocifer for complet skeptic in my campu ministri i ran across thi more time than i care to rememb howev thei disprov their own argument with everi thought everi word everi point of logic that thei us everi moment of share commun speak against their total skeptic their veri insist of try to make sens is eloqu testimoni to assumpt that ar power though silent that is to sai that complet skeptic is imposs and limit skeptic is arbitrari next time you re in a room of skeptic yell out look your fly is undon each person choos what he is skeptic about and what he believ without skeptic to stress thi is to belabor the obviou but it underlin the point that no on can know exhaust how he know what he know pure objectiv is a myth and complet skeptic an impossibl the answer to thi impass li in a 3rd wai of know on which is base on presupposit but if knowledg proce on what must be presuppos befor it is prove the cover is blown on the pretent of critic doubt and critic doubt depend on the idea that human knowledg is total object and neutral in other word anoth myth presupposit my friend it is imposs to doubt anyth unless there is someth we do not doubt our own assumpt presuppost even these can be criticez onli upon the basi of other assumpt presuppostiton ar our silent partner in thought but their silenc must not be mistaken for absenc i tell you what if god condemn me for be honest he is unworthi of my worship better to burn in hell than to serv a tyrant in heaven of cours that is hardli an origin statement milton coin it but it had been in us for millenia it wa even us in the first highland movi but again your presupt is base on a faulti knowledg of the charact of god you ar oper off of a presupposit premis of humanist theologi not what he ha reveal of himself through histori through hi prophet through hi word and lastli but most of all thru hi son if you ar to reject god s annoint savior then reject him from a correct understand of himself rex
