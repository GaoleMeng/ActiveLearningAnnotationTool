file while encrypt technolog can help american protect busi secret and the unauthor releas of person inform it also can be us by terrorist drug dealer and other crimin a state of the art microcircuit call the clipper chip ha been develop by govern engin the chip repres a new approach to encrypt technolog it can be us in new rel inexpens encrypt devic that can be attach to an ordinari telephon it scrambl telephon commun us an encrypt algorithm that is more power than mani in commerci us todai thi new technolog will help compani protect proprietari inform protect the privaci of person phone convers and prevent unauthor releas of data transmit electron at the same time thi technolog preserv the abil of feder state and local law enforc agenc to intercept lawfulli the phone convers of crimin a kei escrow system will be establish to ensur that the clipper chip is us to protect the privaci of law abid american each devic contain the chip will have two uniqu 2 kei number that will be need by author govern agenc to decod messag encod by the devic when the devic is manufactur the two kei will be deposit separ in two kei escrow data base that will be establish by the attornei gener access to these kei will be limit to govern offici with legal author to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american to demonstr the effect of thi new technolog the attornei gener will soon purchas sever thousand of the new devic in addit respect expert from outsid the govern will be offer access to the confidenti detail of the algorithm to assess it capabl and publicli report their find the chip is an import step in address the problem of encrypt s dual edg sword encrypt help to protect the privaci of individu and industri but it also can shield crimin and terrorist we need the clipper chip and other approach that can both provid law abid citizen with access to the encrypt thei need and prevent crimin from us it to hide their illeg activ in order to assess technolog trend and explor new approach like the kei escrow system the presid ha direct govern agenc to develop a comprehens polici on encrypt that accommod the privaci of our citizen includ the need to emploi voic or data encrypt for busi purpos the abil of author offici to access telephon call and data under proper court or other

industri in the global marketplac and the need of u s compani to manufactur and export high technolog product the presid ha direct earli and frequent consult with affect industri the congress and group that advoc the privaci right of individu as polici option ar develop 3 the administr is commit to work with the privat sector to spur the develop of a nation inform infrastructur which will us new telecommun and comput technolog to give american unpreced access to inform thi infrastructur of high speed network inform superhighwai will transmit video imag hdtv program and huge data file as easili as todai s telephon system transmit voic sinc encrypt technolog will plai an increasingli import role in that infrastructur the feder govern must act quickli to develop consist comprehens polici regard it us the administr is commit to polici that protect all american right to privaci while also protect them from those who break the law further inform is provid in an accompani fact sheet the provis of the presid s direct to acquir the new encrypt technolog ar also avail for addit detail call mat heyman nation institut of standard and technolog 301 975 2758 question and answer about the clinton administr s telecommun initi q doe thi approach expand the author of govern agenc to listen in on phone convers a no clipper chip technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american q suppos a law enforc agenc is conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggl ring and intercept a convers encrypt us the devic what would thei have to do to deciph the messag a thei would have to obtain legal author normal a court order to do the wiretap in the first place thei would then present document of thi author to the two entiti respons for safeguard the kei and obtain the kei for the devic be us by the drug smuggler the kei is split into two part which ar store separ in order to ensur the secur of the kei escrow system q who will run the kei escrow data bank a the two kei escrow data bank will be run by two independ entiti at thi point the depart of justic and the administr have yet to determin which agenc will overse the kei escrow data bank q how strong is the secur in the devic how can i be sure how strong the secur is a thi system is more secur than mani other voic encrypt system readili avail todai while the algorithm will remain classifi to protect the secur of the kei escrow system we ar will to invit an independ panel of cryptographi expert to evalu the algorithm to assur all potenti user that there ar no unrecogn vulner q whose decis wa it to propos thi product a the nation secur council the justic depart the commerc depart and other kei agenc were involv in thi decis thi approach ha been endors by the presid the vice presid and appropri cabinet offici q who wa consult the congress industri a we have on go discuss with congress and industri on encrypt issu and expect those discuss to intensifi as we carri out our review of encrypt polici we have brief member of congress and industri leader on the decis relat to thi initi q will the govern provid the hardwar to manufactur a the govern design and develop the kei access encrypt microcircuit but it is not provid the microcircuit to product manufactur product manufactur can acquir the microcircuit from the chip manufactur that produc them q who provid the clipper chip a mykotronx program it at their facil in torranc california and will sell the chip to encrypt devic manufactur the program function could be licens to other vendor in the futur q how do i bui on of these encrypt devic a we expect sever manufactur to consid incorpor the clipper chip into their devic q if the administr were unabl to find a technolog solut like the on propos would the administr be will to us legal remedi to restrict access to more power encrypt devic a thi is a fundament polici question which will be consid dure the broad polici review the kei escrow mechan will provid american with an encrypt product that is more secur more conveni and less expens than other readili avail todai but it is just on piec of what must be the comprehens approach to encrypt technolog which the administr is develop the administr is not sai sinc encrypt threaten the public safeti and effect law enforc we will prohibit it outright as some countri have effect done nor is the u s sai that everi american as a matter of right is entitl to an unbreak commerci encrypt product there is a fals tension creat in the assess that thi issu is an either or proposit rather both concern can be and in fact ar harmoni balanc through a reason balanc approach such as is propos with the clipper chip and similar encrypt techniqu q what doe thi decis indic about how the clinton administr s polici toward encrypt will differ from that of the bush administr a it indic that we understand the import of encrypt technolog in telecommun and comput and ar commit to work with industri and public interest group to find innov wai to protect american privaci help busi to compet and ensur that law enforc agenc have the tool thei need to fight crime and terror q will the devic be export will other devic that us the govern hardwar a voic encrypt devic ar subject to export control requir case by case review for each export is requir to ensur appropri us of these devic the same is true for other encrypt devic on of the attract of thi technolog is the protect it can give to u s compani oper at home and abroad with thi in mind we expect export licens will be grant on a case by case basi for u s compani seek to us these devic to secur their own commun abroad we plan to review the possibl of permit wider export of these product jim gillogli trewesdai 25 astron s r 1993 17 01
