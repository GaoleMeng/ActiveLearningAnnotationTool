jason smith jason atlastel com wrote the discuss begin why doe the univers exist at all on of the law of natur specifi caus and effect seem to dictat at least to thi layman s mind there must be a causal event no reason altern exist i would argu that causal is actual a properti of spacetim caus preced their effect but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the univers our spacetim emerg from noth scienc ha some good candid for an answer i have alwai wonder why christian us the there ar question scienc or atheism cannot answer argument i hope thi is the appropri group to ask thi question the most popular question is the question of origin why doe the univers exist or anyth for that matter i think thi question should actual be split into two part name 1 why is there exist why anyth exist and 2 how did the univers emerg from noth it is clear scienc ha noth to sai about the first question howev is it a meaning question after all i would sai it isn t consid the follow a die hard skeptic be be it human or whatev attempt to doubt on s veri exist sinc it is so easi to doubt everyth els i cannot be _sure_ the world exist it mai be my mind fool me can i ever be sure i exist howev it is onli possibl to exist or not to exist someon insert an appropri shakespear quot here a be that doe not exist cannot doubt on s exist a be that doe exist can doubt on s exist but thi would be pointless the be would exist anywai let us return to the origin question why a be that doe not exist doe not need ani reason for it non exist thi be is not _sure_ whether anyth els exist but hi mind but let us assum that the world exist independ of the mind the object postul the question why anyth exist can be counter by demand answer to a question why there is noth in nothing or in non exist actual both question turn out to be devoid of mean thing that exist do and thing that don t exist don t exist tautolog at it best i serious doubt god could have an answer to thi question some christian i have talk to have said that actual god is himself the exist howev i see sever problem with thi answer first it inevit lead to the conclus that god is actual _all_ exist good and evil devil and angel us and them thi is pantheism not christian anoth answer is that god is the _sourc_ of all exist thi sound much better but i am tempt to ask doe god himself exist then if god is the sourc of hi own exist it can onli mean that he ha in term of human time alwai exist but thi is not the same as the sourc of all exist thi argument sound like god doe not exist but meta exist and from hi meta exist perspect he creat exist i think thi is actual a nonsolut a mere twist of word the best answer i have heard is that human reason is incap of understand such question be an atheist myself i do not accept such answer sinc i do not have ani other method the second question how did the univers emerg from noth belong to the domain of scienc and i for on do not doubt the question can be answer by it method mani cosmologist have suggest that it is entir possibl for univers to emerg from vacuum thi possibl ha been suggest in a recent hawk biographi see also lizhi shuxian creation of the univers world scientif 1989 howev i think the sci group ar more appropri for discuss like thi as far as i can tell the veri law of natur demand a why that isn t true of someth outsid of natur i e super natur thi is not true scienc is a collect of model tell us how not why someth happen i cannot see ani good reason why the why question would be bound onli to natur thing assum that the supernatur domain exist if supernatur be exist it is as appropri to ask why thei do so as it is to ask why we exist i believ the genet code will be entir deciph in our lifetim but we will not see man convert entir inert materi into self sustain reproduc life ever i ve never been much of a prophet though i can t even pictur new york in my mind 8 i don t believ ani technolog would be abl to produc that necessari spark of life despit have all of the part avail just my opinion thi opinion is also call vital name that live system ar somehow _fundament_ differ from inanim system do christian in gener adopt thi posit what would happen when scientist announc thei have creat primit life sai small bacteria in a lab there is a problem with your propheci artifici life ha been creat although not yet in a chemic form comput simul of evolut contain system that ar as much aliv as ani bacterium although their code is electron as well as their metabol see a recent book steven levi artifici life the quest for a new creation jonathan cape london 1992 artifici chemic life is just around the corner after all no spark of life ha been found to be necessari live system do not violat ani physic law as we know them you don t mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf dure your research do you after all if we of christ ar delud ourselv you realli have noth to worri about eh exactli thi is why i think atheist should _not_ post ani evangel atheist argument to soc religion group sinc peopl who seek to find peac in religion must be allow to gather togeth i would normal have ask these question in alt atheism or talk religion misc but it seem mani christian do not read these group petri ___ petri pihko kem pmp mathemat is the truth ___ pihati 15 c finou oulu fi physic is the rule of sf 90650 oulu
