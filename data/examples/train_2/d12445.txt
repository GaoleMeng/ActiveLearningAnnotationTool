idh nessi mcc ac uk ian hawkin write when construct activ filter odd valu of resistor ar often requir i e someth like a 3 14 k ohm resistor it seem best to choos common capacitor valu and cope with the strang resist then demand is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resist given fix resistor of the standard 12 valu per decad 1 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 2 3 3 etc it is a common enough problem yet i cant recal se a program that tell that rx ry rz give rq start with q and find prefer valu x y and z i onc wrote such a program in bbc basic it wa veri crude and took around 5 second to do an exhaust search with a small amount of intellig and told you the best combin rq and the best below rq if you want to write on just store the prefer valu in an arrai and then search the solut space us three nest loop i m sure you could knock thi up in an hour christoph christoph hick paradis is a linear gaussian world cmh uk ac cam eng also report to tast hot and sweati
