mlee post royalroad ca malcolm lee write dpw sei cmu edu david wood write mlee ra royalroad ca malcolm lee write these law written for the israelit god s chosen peopl whom god had expressli set apart from the rest of the world the israelit were a direct wit to god s exist to disobei god after know that god is real would be an outright denial of god and therefor immedi punish rememb these law were written for a differ time and appli onli to god s chosen peopl but jesu ha chang all of that we ar live in the ag of grace sin is no longer immedi punish by death there is repent and there is salvat through our lord jesu christ and not just for a few chosen peopl salvat is avail to everyon jew and gentil alik sorri if thi is late for the thread but i thought god wa suppos to be constant and never chang how do you reconcil thi common christian view with the paragraph abov god never chang sorri but ye he doe by your own descript he still love us send jesu wa on of hi attempt to reconcil with mankind humor thi notion of an all know all power god who must attempt to reconcil with hi lowli creation i realiz that it is not possibl to penetr such logic but is there ani chanc that you might consid that an omnipot god need not attempt anyth and further that an attempt to reconcil impli a lack of omnisci what you ar do here is project human weak onto your god also while we re at it 1 how do you reconcil a kind and love god with the judeo christian view that sin wa at on time immedi punish by death wa kill peopl for sin god s wai of show kind and love sin in the face of god wa punish by immedi death there ar sever ot passag to back thi up god is god but all human ar sinner thu all pre jesu human should have been punish with death we aren t punish with sin now of cours becaus god ha chang he requir a brutal sadist sacrific of hi own blood in order to allow us to sin without immedi death he cannot toler the prescenc of sin in hi midst yet he doe so now he ha chang the sadist murder of hi own son ha made him more toler of our sin besid hi midst is everywher so your statement is meaningless he toler sin in hell which sure is in hi midst as well also given that he is all know he must have etern knowledg of who will commit which sin as well as when and where so what doe toler have to do with anyth all of thi is absolut nonsens unless your god is not inde all know and all power or unless he doesn t take the person interest in everydai affair that you claim and the israelit knew thi and still some of them chose to disobei and were destroi were these peopl kind and love themselv not relev the claim of kind and loving wa made by you in refer to your god the natur of hi creation victim is not at issu god gave them everi break he could but in the end he realli had no choic in the matter i see an all know god who did not know what the ultim outcom would be and an all power god who had no choic in the matter mindmush see as how we were fail to achiev salvat on our own he sent hi son to die for us to be the ultim sin offer did i miss someth did you give some indic at to why a kind and love god should requir sadist human sacrific to allow hi own botch creation to achiev salvat 2 is the fact the he no longer doe thi an admiss on hi part of have made a mistak he sent hi son as a consol to us out of love i note that your answer physic follow my question but i fail to discern a connect between the two by the wai for what am i be consol 3 now that we ar live in the ag of grace doe thi mean that for our sin god now damn us to etern hell after we die rather than kill us immedi if so is thi etern damnat an exampl of a kind and love god hei let s be fair for a moment here kind and love doe not mean a free ride why not by the wai i note for the record that you didn t answer the question there is an amount of give and take as in ani relationship parent ar suppos to be kind and love but doe that mean that children can do whatev thei want not part of be a parent mean administ punish when the child is at fault death and or etern damnat is your idea of correct punish i hope you aren t a parent part of be a parent mean give instruct god test us through the trial of life such that we mai grow stronger he teach what is right and what is wrong thi is quit an elabor fantasi that you ve construct but sadli it lack a basi in realiti it also doe not address the question that i rais the consequ of our action ar made clear to us be it heaven or be it hell if god did not follow through with what he ha warn us about he would not be a veri good parent the god that you describ is not a good parent but a tyrant in parent if a parent issu a warn but doe not follow through with it the children will not take that parent s word veri serious god doe the same by tell us who have ear to hear what to do and what not to do by life s trial we see the folli of do our own will rather than hi he warn us about the consequ of reject him when it come time for judgement sorri wa that the god of the bibl whose rule i am to follow or the god of the koran the veda the book of koresh oh ye it s all so clear do we follow him i will bulli for you
