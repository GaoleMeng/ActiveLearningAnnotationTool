flygar write i get the impress hasan realiz he goof and is now try to drop the thread let him it might save some miniscul portion of hi sorri face not realli sinc i am a logic person who like further himself from ani name call i start trash ani articl that contain such abus without respond to and sometim not even read articl written by those who acquir such bad habit from bad compani ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the wai never bother respond to there wa no name call henc the assumpt do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer or to refresh your memori doe the human right issu in the area appli to palestinian onli also do you claim there is such a thing as forfeit a human right if that s possibl then explain to the rest of us how there can exist ani such thing us your logic and convinc us thi is your golden chanc jona flygar well ok let s see what master of wisdom mr jona flygar wrote that can be wisdom respond to ar you call name or give me a titl if the first read your paragraph abov if not i accept the titl in order to let you get into the um well debat again master of wisdom write in 1993mar31 101957 frej teknikum uu se hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestinean were there for 18 month and thei ar come back when you agre to give palestinean their human right afteral human right arenot negoti correct me if i m wrong but isn t the right to on s life _also_ a human right or doe it onli appli to palestinian no it is everybodi s right howev when a killer kill then he is give up willingli or unwillingli hi life s right to the societi the societi repres by the gover would exercis it duti by depriv the killer off hi life s right so then it s all right for israel to kill the peopl who kill isra the old ey for an ey think funni i thought modern legal system were made to counter exactli that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on give me name titl i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctli sigh when you ar intention neglect the most import fact that the whole isra presenc in the occupi territori is illegitim and henc all their action their court their law ar illegitim on the ground of occupi territori no i am _not_ neglect that i m mere ask you whether the exist of isra citicen in the wb or in gaza invalid those individu right to live a as you so eloqu put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be us in the territori later also you have not adress my question if the isra also have human right what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you respond to the point is that sinc israel is occupi then it is automat depriv itself from some of it right to the occupi palestinean which is exactli similar the automat depriv of a killer from hi right of life to the societi if a state can depriv all it s citizen of human right by it action then tell me why _ani_ human live todai should have ani right at all in conjugt with the abov when a group of peopl occupi other territori and rule them by forc then thi group would be willingli or unwillingli depriv from some of it right such as the right to live that s nice the swedish govern is a group of peopl that rule me by forc doe that give me the right to kill them do you consid yourself that you have pose a worthi question here worthi or not i wa just appli your logic to a relat problem am i to assum you admit it wouldn t hold what kind of right and how much would be depriv is anoth issu the answer is to be found in a certain system such as intern law us law isra law and now it s veri conveni to start us the legal system to prove a point excus me while i throw up ok master of wisdom is throw up you peopl stai awai from the screen while he is do it oh did you too watch that comedi where thei pipe water through the telephon i ll let you in on a secret it s not for real take my word for it it seem that the us law repres by us state dept in thi case is look to the other wai around when violenc occur in occupi territori anywai as for hama then obvious thei turn to the islam system and which system do you propos we us to solv the me problem the question is not which system would solv the me problem why becaus ani system can solv it the law of minist sharon sai kick palestinean out of here all palestin i ask for which system should be us that will preserv human right for all peopl involv i assum that wa obviou but i won t repeat that mistak now that i have straighten that out i m eagerli await your repli joseph weitz administr respons for jewish colon said it best when write in hi diari in 1940 between ourselv it must be clear that there is no room for both peopl togeth in thi countri we shall not achiev our goal of be an independ peopl with the arab in thi small countri the onli solut is a palestin at least western palestin west of the jordan river without arab and there is no other wai than to transfer the arab from here to the neighbour countri to transfer all of them not on villag not on tribe should be left onli after thi transfer will the countri be abl to absorb the million of our own brethren there is no other wai out davar 29 septemb 1967 courtesi of marc afifi just a question if we ar to disregard the rather obviou refer to get israel out of me on wai or the other in both plo coven and hama charter that s the english translat if you have other inform i d be interest to have you translat it why should we give ani credenc to a _privat_ paper even older i m not go to get into the question if he wrote the abov but it s fairli obviou all parti in the conflict have their share of fanat guess what those ar not the peopl that will make ani last peac in the region ever it s those who ar will to make a tabula rasa and start over and will to give in order to get someth back we and our either refer to zionist or jew i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist isra system for solv the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is _not_ an answer sinc i ask for a system that could solv the problem you said ani could be us then you provid a contradict guess where that take your logic to never never land the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the wai let me add that these cute quot you put at the end ar a real bummer when i try give your post ani credit jona flygar
