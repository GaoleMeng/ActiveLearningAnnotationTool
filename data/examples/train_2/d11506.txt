kondar purccvm bitnet i think anonym post do help in focus our attent on the content of on s messag sure lot of anonym post ar abus or frivol but in most case these ar by user who find the anon facil novel onc the novelti wear off thei ar stop their prank morgan engr uki edu we morgan i don t mind see the miscellan hatr prejudic racism those thing ar part of our natur howev the notion of provid anonym s shield for these idea repuls me if thei have such strong feel why can t thei put their name s on their post quit frankli i loath commun with peopl who refus to us their name dcluni pax tpa com au david cluni mani seem to question the valu of anonym but who ar thei to sai what risk anoth individu should take there is no question that in thi rather conserv societi that we live in hold certain view make certain statement adopt a certain lifestyl ar like to result in public censur ridicul loss of statu employ or even legal action given the heterogen of the legal jurisdict from where the mani contributor to usenet post who know what is legal and what is not some sai that anonym poster ar coward and should stand up and be count perhap that is on point of view but what right do these detractor have to exercis such censorship from doug cc ysu edu doug sewel why is it censorship to not expect someon to speak for themselv without the cloak of anonym thi is at best a lame argument you tell me why what you have to sai requir anonym and you tell me why the wish of a major of non anonym user of a newsgroup should be disregard when thei don t want anonym post anonym user have less right than ani other thei ar not legitim usenet particip i would not honor rfd cfv control messag or vote from on brad clarinet com brad templeton i can think of no disadvantag caus by anon post site that doesn t alreadi exist other than the fact that thei do make more naiv net user who don t know how to post anonym the old wai more prone to do it from mandel netcom com tom mandel i cannot speak for other but i regard anonym post in a seriou discuss as pretti much worthless view that hide behind the veil of anon ar hardli worth the troubl of read n8729 anon penet fi hank pankei sinc i began post anonym to show support for gener principl of person privaci i have been subject to far more abus and attack than i ever receiv befor peopl seem to find it easier to flame and insult someon whose name thei don t know perhap it s easier to pretend that there is no person behind the email address who feel the sting of abus comment anonym doe hinder some method of control other poster action peopl who seek such control will natur oppos it from 00acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu instead of make thi a free er medium by allow poster to protect themselv with anonym simpli requir that all poster be prepar to discuss their sourc of inform and take the heat for unsubstanti dribbl thi seem to be the wai thing ar current done xtkmg trentu ca kate gregori in misc kid there ar three thread go on start by anonym poster on wa about chang job so as to work less hour job share and so on from a woman who didn t want anyon at her current place of work to know she wa think of look for work elsewher the next wa from a woman who is think of have a babi sometim soon and doesn t want cowork friend famili etc etc to know all about it but who want advic the third is about sex after parenthood actual thi wa start by peopl post in the usual wai but then it wa point out that the anonym post servic might let more peopl particip misc kid doesn t seem to be suffer ani harm from the presenc of anonym poster in fact it seem to have been help by it hoei zogwarg etl armi mil dan hoei while there ha never been ani real secur against anonym or forg post on usenet the process ha until now been suffici inconveni error prone and undocu to limit it us by person who have not learn the cultur of the net on the other hand a recent us of the anonym post servic on sci math seem seem to be a student ask help on a homework problem it ha now been attribut to a teacher ask for an explan of a dubiou answer in hi teach guid he sai hi new post is broken so he is us the anonym servic as a mail to new gatewai karl barru ele9sf menudo uh edu some argu that the opinion of the peopl who hide behind a veil of anonym ar worthless and that peopl should own up to their thought i agre with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sit around engag in socrat dialogu freeli exchang our opinion in an effort to learn but in an ideal world nobodi will threaten you for your thought or ridicul you but we live in a world where the peopl who don t agre with you mai try to harm you let s face it some peopl aren t go to agre with your opinion no matter how logic you try to present it or how reason out it mai be thi is sad sinc it doe restrict peopl from voic their opinion red redpol neoucom edu richard e depew the consensu seem to be that a gener anonym post servic such as that at anon penet fi seem suffici corros of the trust and civil of the net that thi particular experi should be end perhap the next time the question come up we can sai we tri it we learn it doe more harm than good and we stop it from c96 vm urz uni heidelberg de alexand eichen anonym post ha not creat major problem asid from anger irat peopl like you who would rather ban anonym pseudonym post altogeth becaus real men can stand up for what thei said or compar pueril argument as other have brought up dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hay what a primal exampl of human natur i have three question for you folk do peopl realli sai differ thing to each other base upon whether their ident is or isn t known ar peopl realli so affect by what other peopl sai that the verbag is label abus most importantli on a forum that prize itself on the freedom of commun that it enjoi is there realli such a thing as freedom of commun from terri geovis gvc com terri mcgonig sigh just how mani anon servic ar need will everybodi start run on soon what s the purpos who stand to benefit when there ar n anon servic then 2 n then n 2 out there where ha thi sudden fasin with anon servic come from for better or imho wors it look like we er gonna get stuck with these thing and as much as i don t like the idea of servic like thi becom the norm i don t realli think there s much to be done sinc it s obviou that anyon who want to can set on up with a bit of work karl_kleinpast cs cmu edu karl kleinpast weak reason with freedom come respons dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hay respons isn t real if it is enforc true responsibilti come with no coercion _____ 8 6 should anonym post to all group be allow morgan engr uki edu we morgan i will be the first to admit that i hold some controversi opinion inde i m sure that none of us ar complet orthodox in our opinion howev i ve receiv hundr of anonym email messag over the last few year fewer than 20 of them were reason post made with good motiv it s get more and more difficult to rememb why we need anonym at all the abus ar onc again lous thing up for those who truli need the servic or those who would put it to good us i m not suggest that we should ban anonym server as i ve said there ar sever situat in which anonym is a good thing tm howev the notion that anonym s shield should be automat extend to everi usenet discuss is ridicul it open the door to further abus twpierc unix amherst edu tim pierc of cours how doe on determin whether a group request the servic a flat major of poster vote in favor a posit margin of 100 vote or what no on speak for a newsgroup i m not convinc by the argument that an anonym post servic for all newsgroup is inher a bad idea simpli becaus it s a divers from the statu quo sinc the statu quo previous permit anonym post to no newsgroup ani anonym post servic would reject the statu quo hartman ulog uucp richard m hartman write it is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best abl to decid whether it want to allow anonym post instead of have them forc upon them by an servic administr ogil quad uchicago edu brian w ogilvi the servic provid a mechan for forward mail to the origin poster sinc most usenet reader don t know john smith from jane doe except by their opinion and their address the effect of have an anonym post to which mail repli can be direct is minim except for those who person know the poster and the lack of anonym could be seriou ani mechan like thi is liabl to abus but the benefit as well as the cost must be weigh limit the servic to alt group or specif group would not help those who want advic on sensit issu in more profession newsgroup from tarl sw stratu com tarl neustaedt an addit point is that some of us find anonim in technic matter to be profoundli offens anonim in differ forum ha differ mean if i get a phone call from someon who won t identifi himself i hang up if i get u s mail with no return address it goe into the garbag unopen if someon accost me in the street while wear a mask i back awai carefulli and expect violenc in a technic discuss anonim mean that the individu isn t will to associ himself with the matter be discuss which discredit hi utter and make listen to them a wast of time anonim lead to fun psych experi the literatur is fill with all the variou thing that peopl will do anonym that thei won t otherwis includ on notori studi involv tortur that would not have pass todai s ethic standard fun stuff in ani case fine leav us out of it from jbuck fornei berkelei edu joe buck you obvious have never submit an articl to a refere journal where you will receiv anonym review through a server the editor that behav much like the on in finland e g you mai repli and the editor will maintain the anonym your comparison of someon who want to express him herself on a technic issu anonym with a person who approach you on a dark street with a ski mask is just emotion overwrought nonsens such poster pose no physic threat to you jik mit edu j kamen it seem obviou to me that the default should be not to allow anonym post in a newsgroup the usenet ha alwai oper on the principl that the statu quo should be kept unless there s a larg number of peopl who want to chang it if someon realli need to post a messag anonym in a newsgroup in which thi usual isn t done thei can usual find someon on the net to do thi for them thei don t need an autom servic to do it and the autom servic is by it natur incap of make the judgment call necessari to decid whether a particular post realli need to be anonym from twpierc unix amherst edu tim pierc for ani newsgroup you name i bet i can envis a scenario involv a need for secreci if an accur content base filter of each anonym post could be devis to screen out those that don t requir secreci wonder but it can t be done from lhp daimi aau dk lass hiller e petersen if a newsgroup want to be nois and nuisanc free then it should call for moder thi should happen on a per newsgroup basi and not as a gener usenet ban on anonym post of cours on principl of moder might be to keep out all anonym post and could be achiev automat it would still be _moder_ person i would prefer moder criteria be base on actual content david a cluni dcluni pax tpa com au if a group doesn t want to receiv certain post it should becom moder there ar clearli defin mechan on non alt group for thi to take place an autom moder exclud post from certain eg anonym site or individu could easili be establish if anyon want to take such a draconian approach then thei ar welcom to do so and good luck to them i doubt if i will be read their group from dave frackit uucp dave ratcliff what possibl need would someon have for post anonym to a sci group sure most adult ar will to post under their own name why would thei want to hide behind an anonym post servic asham of what thei have to sai or just try to rile peopl without fear of be identifi anonym post have their place in certain group if i or anyon els need to tell you what those group ar then you ve been on anoth planet breath exot gase for too long from karl_kleinpast cs cmu edu it s bloodi fascin that all the propon of unimped univers anon post access can t seem to find ani middl ground at all why is there such a percept of absolut where doe thi instant gratif syndrom come from i want anon access and i want it now who ar the control freak here from 00acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu rememb thi is a newsgroup for poster write about scientif issu anonym discuss of scientif issu lead to bad scienc from nore netcom com jon nore though mani have person philosoph argument against anonym poster their argument have not been compel enough to convinc me that omni newsgroup anonym post should be ban or sever restrict though i cannot prove it it seem to me that those who do not like anonym post in principl do so for reason that ar person read psycholog discomfort rather than for reason relat to maintain the integr of usenet rememb it is imposs to be abl to ascertain all the conceiv and legitim motiv for anonym post to newsgroup on normal would not deem to be sensit in gener i fear even let newsgroup reader vote on either allow or not allow anonym post sinc a priori thei cannot know all the motiv of legitim poster and i do not believ that ani system should ever be institut that would inhibit the post of legitim and inform post lestat wixer cactu org lyle j mackei write i person don t believ that pseudonym post ar appropri in a seriou discuss area if there is a legitim reason for conceal the poster ident perhap but simpli becaus thei re not so sure if thei want their name attach doesn t qualifi as legitim in my book oh and if you can come up with a legitim purpos for anonym post pleas enlighten me sderbi crick ssctr bcm tmc edu stuart p derbi three of our the u s s found father madison hamilton and jai seem to think anonym post wa ok the federalist paper were origin print in new york newspap with authorship attribut to publiu i wonder if you would find their purpos legitim _____ 8 7 what should system oper do with anonym post from emcguir intellect com ed mcguir i would like to know how to junk all articl post by the anonym servic current be discuss ideal i would actual tell my feed site not to feed me articl post by the anonym servic assum the c new perform releas what is a simpl wai to accomplish thi or where should i look to learn how to do it myself from dcluni pax tpa com au david cluni that s a bit draconian isn t it have your user unanim decid that thei would like you to do thi or have you decid for them from emcguir intellect com ed mcguir good question nobodi ha decid i have no definit plan to do thi just want the technic data carl kleinpast karl_kleinpast godiva nectar cs cmu edu were i to be in the posit of offer such a servic again my promis of protect of anonym would be limit not on the basi of person opinion of what get post but on the basi of post which disrupt the smooth oper of the usenet the most obviou and direct recours would be to out the abus individu less drastic possibl exist the softwar support a fire extinguish by which individu can be prevent from post john iastat edu john hascal sinc when is usenet a democraci if someon want to run an anonym servic that s their busi if you want to put that host in your killfil that s your busi if a newsadmin want to blanket drop all post from that site that s between them and the other peopl at that site if everyon ignor a servic the servic effect doesn t exist from jik athena mit edu jonathan i kamen nntp server that allow post from anyon ar not a servic to the net thei do the net a disservic termin server have the same problem as open nntp server thei allow peopl who want to do illeg immor uneth thing on the internet to do so without account there ar by now public access site all over thi countri if not all over the world that allow veri inexpens access to the usenet and the internet there is no reason for nntp server to allow anyon to post messag through them and there is no reason for termin server to allow anyon to connect to them and then make outbound connect through them perhap when it wa harder to get to the internet or the usenet open server could be justifi but not now jbotz mtholyok edu jurgen botz i think that what these point show clearli is that an anonym post servic ha a great deal of respons both toward it client and toward the net as a whole such a servic should imho have a set of well defin rule and a contract that it client should sign under the term of which thei ar assur anonym from an8785 anon penet fi is the problem that some ar us to punish poster who ar upset in some vagu wai by complain to the usual acquiesc sysadmin or organ that the poster belong to that sure is the most gutless approach to solv problem but my experi on the net show that the same user who vilifi anonym post ar the first to write obsess detail grievanc to the poster s supervisor when hi or her tranquil is disturb by some intrus or subvers post or anoth anonym post prevent just thi kind of intimid from gandalf cyberspac org eric schill the main point i would like to make here is that while we can go through and revis the new sw to reject anon post to technic newsgroup or some such thing i think the attempt will prove futil each attempt to modifi new can result in a chang approach by anon servic provid to thwart the chang i think thi would be pointless from julf penet fi johan helsingiu i have tri to stai out of thi discuss and see where the discuss lead but now i ralli feel like i have to speak up i have repeatedli made clear that i do block user if thei continu their abus after have been warn in mani case the user have taken heed of the warn and stop and in some case even apolog in public and when the warn ha not had the desir effect i have block a number of user i have also block access to group where the readership ha taken a vote to ban anonym post although i feel chang the newsgroup statu to moder is the onli perman solut for newsgroup that want to formal discuss red redpol neoucom edu richard e depew doe thi mean that you ar volunt to issu a request for discuss to ban anonym post or to moder each of the 4000 newsgroup that your server can reach i don t think so but thi illustr the troubl that your server is caus pleas listen to the consensu of the new administr in thi group ani newsgroup should be consult befor let your server post messag to that group from c96 vm urz uni heidelberg de alexand eichen there is no pompou consensu of the new administr here mayb you would like to invent on there is a sizeabl number of peopl who ar concern about the possibl and to a minor extent about the actual abus of the server as it is configur now these concern ar respect johan is deal with them there ar some few who rage with foam befor their mouth and condemn the servic altogeth and a number who defend it point out like kate gregori that even a group like misc kid can benefit from pseudonym post from julf penet fi johan helsingiu i have answer a lot of person mail relat to server abus and as a result of that block a number of abus user i have also withdrawn the servic from sever newsgroup where the user have taken a vote on the issu i have not made ani comment on new admin polici partli becaus the newli implement password featur as a emerg measur against a secur hole ha kept me realli busi answer user queri the last two week and partli becaus i feel it is not for me to justifi the servic but for the user the problem with new admin polici is that the readership is rather elect repres peopl whith a strong interest in centralis control from hartman ulog uucp richard m hartman thi seem to be a rather bigot attitud i would consid that thi group is for anyon who wish to discuss how the net should be control sai that we onli have an interest in central control is a clear indic of bia you ar perfectli welcom to join in the discuss here to promot your view on control jbuck ohm berkelei edu thi whole debat is a lot of sound and furi signifi noth becaus even if you all decid to ban anonym post server it is not enforc the onli peopl who conceiv could enforc retrict ar those that control the intern link polici chang should be made by cooper not by attempt to dictat you need to persuad those who run the servic to act like thi through friendli persuas not by try to beat them over the head with a stick especi a stick you don t even have spp zabriski berkelei edu steve pope i am find thi bia against pseudonym bore our friend post through penet ha a point the old guard would like to keep their network the wai it alwai ha been and thi new thing these pseudonym server cut into their turf so thei whine and bitch about it and everi time there s the slightest abus such as somebodi s sig be too long thei try to parlai that into an argument against pseudonym i ll go on record as sai three cheer for the admin at anon server like penet pax and n7kbt and for all the access servic provid who ar will to preserv their client privaci and a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonym mimir stein u washington edu al bill i wouldn t help peopl get rid of anon post as a group if you don t like what someon sai then you put that anon address in your kill file not all of them of cours if and when i get an anon site go i m just go to assign fake name like jsmith instead of anon5564 to avoid most of the hassl you ll never know it is anonym will you from ann alcor concordia ca ann bennett i must admit to some astonish at thi argument i see the valu of anonym post under some circumst yet believ strongli that these should be identifi as such so that peopl who do not wish to read materi from peopl who won t identifi themselv don t have to i fail to see what good you would be accomplish and inde surmis that you will caus mani peopl inconveni and annoy by hide the anonym of post from your anonym site would you care to justifi where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent peopl from effect filter their new as thei see fit from dcluni pax tpa com au david cluni i thought i wa out of reach here in australia too unfortun on of the us site involv in the us au feed complain to the australian academ reasearch network through whom my site is connect not about anyth in particular just the concept of anonym mail have no redeem featur and consum a narrow bandwidth link with which i can t argu and that wa that stop the servic or face disconnect i consid the demis of my servic to have been rather unfortun and i wish the finnish remail luck it is a piti that there ar veri few if ani similar servic provid with in the us i guess that s the benefit of have a constitut that guarante on freedom of speech and a legal and polit system that conspir to subvert it in the name of the public good _____ 8 8 what is go on with anon penet fi run by j helsingiu from karl_kleinpast cs cmu edu funni how beat the rest of the usenet over the head with a stick is ok if it s anon penet fi and univers anon access but somehow peopl on the other side of the same equat not even argu to shut it off entir but rather just to have some control appli to the abus that manifest themselv aren t allow to do that i have written to johan sever time in the last coupl of week he us to repli to me quit readili after all i wa the sourc of the softwar as origin deliv to him he us to be downright _prompt_ about repli to me funni now he s be an impolit bastard who doesn t answer mail _at_all_ even when it consist of realli veri civil queri from julf penet fi johan helsingiu in your mail you told me you sent me on or more messag on feb 8th feb 7th and 8th the server wa down and the flood of mail that result from the server come up again crash my own mail host the problem wa aggreg by an abus user send thousand of messag to anoth user fill up that user mailbox the bounc messag end up in my mailbox overflow my local disk as well i can onli suppos that your messag got lost in that hassl as i have tri to answer as much as possibl of the anon relat messag i get from routin mi addess messag to complaint about the servic on the averag i spend 4 5 hour per dai answer anon relat messag from karl_kleinpast cs cmu edu why is it that everybodi els ha to put up with the impolit and insensit of the misus of anon penet fi whose definit of polit and sens appli and why why is univers anon access consid to be within the realm of thi fuzzi concept of polit in the first place i think johan ha long sinc cross the line into be a rude bastard and i told him so in privat mail a littl while ago at thi point i deepli regret a have creat an anonym system support 1 newsgroup and b have given the code to johan i didn t copyright it but i thought that some concept of polit and good sens might follow it to new home interest that johan s idea of polit and good sens seem to have nearli no interesect with mine i could even cope with univers anon access _if_ johan would be will to engag in abus control but somehow that seem to be outsid the rang of realiti from julf penet fi johan helsingiu there is no wai for me to convei how sad and upset your messag made me i do to some extent understand your feel but it still feel realli bad run the server requir get us to a lot of flame but mindlessli abus hate mail is so much easier to deal with than someth like thi as i do respect and valu your view and opinion to a high degre no i m not ask for sympathi i just want you to know that i am realli give your view quit a lot of weight when i ask for the softwar i wa actual onli go to provid the servic to scandinavian user but a lot of peopl request that i keep the servic open to the intern commun i now realiz that i ought to have contact you at that point to ask how you feel about me us your stuff in such a context again i realli want to apologis and i will replac the remain few piec of code thet still stem from your system unfortun there is no wai to remov the idea and structur i got from you again i am realli sorri that the result of your work end up be us in a wai that you don t approv of and i will be give a lot of hard thought to the possibl of shut down the server alltogeth from karl_kleinpast cs cmu edu i think i m feel especi rude and impolit if it s good for johan it s good for me after all he didn t ask the greater usenet whether univers anon access wa a good idea he just did it ye i m a serious rude pain in the ass now and i think i ll arm the usenet death penalti slightli modifi not for strateg whole site attack but tactic assault just an 0 9 anon penet fi destruct onli outsid alt too let s sai to parrot thi line peopl have been do thing like the udp that is cancel other post for year no on could ever stop them and it s onli polit and good sens that ha prevent them up to now in fact i have 8 peopl who have express privat the desir and abil to arm the udp ps no in fact there ar not 8 newsadmin readi to arm the udp it would be amus to know how mani peopl gulp hard when thei read that though i don t see it as ani differ from johan s configur pp now that i ve calm some fear by the abov ps there ar 2 newsadmin readi to arm the udp thei ve ask for my code i haven t sent it yet onli on site would be necessari to bring anon penet fi to a screech halt anyon can implement the udp on their own if thei care to polit and good sens prevent them from do so i wonder how long befor on form of impolit bring on anoth form from julf penet fi johan helsingiu it would be trivial easi to bring anon penet fi to a screech halt in fact it ha happen a coupl of time alreadi but as we ar talk threat here let me make on as well a veri simpl on if somebodi us someth like the udp or malici bring down anon penet fi by some other mean it will stai down but i will let the user know why and name the person who did it ok as somebodi said on thi thread you have to take person respons for your action right from av20 ccc amdahl com 134 atul v salgaonkar i am veri grate and appreci of thi servic courtesei of penet fi some import question about my person life career job were resolv due to kind help of other peopl who had been thru similar situat in return i have also repli to anon post where i thought i could make a posit contribut in gener anon servic is a great in my opinion although like
