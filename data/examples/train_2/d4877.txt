kazsato twic co jp write i d like to know if there is ani system cpu hd arrai framebuff which can plai and record hdtv qualiti move pictur in realtim hdtv ha about 6mb frame so record plai move pictur will need about 180mb sec bandwidth i m think to treat the raw data not compress actual for digit hdtv system that s far higher bandwidth than you need unless there s some reason you must work in fulli uncompress hdtv also my calcul is that each frame should be well under 6mb even us 24 bit pixel which is more bit than you actual need 15 or 18 should be enough for a move pictur 1600x1100x16bit is 3 5mb i m guess at hdtv resolut it mai be a bit wider than 1600 i m fairli sure of the 1100 number for most of the digit propos i hope you have a veri fast memori system as well 180mb s while displai will requir a heavili interleav vram system unless you have a _veri_ compel reason i d advis try to us at least somewhat compress data you don t have to go to full compress to get to a level where the data io requir ar much cheaper and easier to deal with gnu emac is a lisp oper system disguis as a word processor doug mohnei in comp arch randel jesup jack of quit a few trade commodor engin jesup cbmvax commodor com or rutger cbmvax jesup
